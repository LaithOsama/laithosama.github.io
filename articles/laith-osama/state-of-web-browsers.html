      The state of web browsers

  <main>
    <p>In the world of web browsing, a staggering 90% of browsers find their
    foundation in the Google Blink engine. Alas, this engine, like numerous
    other offerings from Google, is regrettably marred by subpar craftsmanship.
    Behold, a web engine of great complexity and bloated proportions. The
    same can be said in Gecko and Webkit. Many claim
    that the intricacy of these browsers is necessary to navigate the
    complexities of the web. Yet, if we were devoid of such convoluted
    creations as Google Chrome and Firefox, we would not find ourselves mired
    in this wretched state of web pages. Alas, modern browsers, though they
    offer opportunities, also contribute to the deterioration of the web. Alas,
    we cannot hope to solve a problem with yet another problem.</p>
    <h2>Introducing Qutebrowser: The Epitome of a Perfect Browser</h2>
    <p>As for the browser I embrace, Qutebrowser has been my loyal companion
    for half a year. I dare say it reigns supreme as the paramount web browser
    of our time. Indeed, Qutebrowser embodies the essence of a perfect browser.
    Its minimalist user interface gracefully refrains from devouring half of my
    screen, its keybindings are nothing short of sublime, and it fiercely
    guards user privacy while consuming fewer resources than its counterparts.
    It resolutely eschews unsolicited connections, and its configuration file
    grants unprecedented versatility. Alas, it does possess certain drawbacks,
    including its reliance on the intricate QtWebEngine (which traces its roots
    to the chromium blink engine), composed in a programming language known for
    its slowless. Nonetheless, the bulk of qutebrowser's demanding tasks
    are competently handled by the efficient Qt and QtWebKit/QtWebEngine in
    C++. Thus, its performance surpasses initial expectations. Additionally,
    qutebrowser boasts a multitude of dependencies. However, a beacon of hope
    beckons in the form of a project called <a href=
    "https://drewdevault.com/2021/09/11/visurf-announcement.html">visurf</a>,
    which shows great promise.</p>
    <h2>Indispensable Features for an Exemplary Browser</h2>
    <p>A truly exemplary browser must possess a range of indispensable
    features. First and foremost, it should offer seamless browsing without the
    encumbrance of a mouse, accompanied by a link hint feature. Furthermore, a
    minimalist graphical user interface is essential to maximize the
    utilization of the small size 12-inch laptops. A
    well-written web engine is paramount, supporting JavaScript and captivating
    CSS features in moderation. Moreover, it should embrace the Gemini
    protocol. Ideally, such a browser would be constructed using fast
    languages such as C. The presence of a customizable configuration
    file allows for portability and adaptability. An invaluable attribute is
    the ability to automatically redirect to alternative platforms, such as
    invidious in lieu of YouTube, nitter in place of Twitter, and librereddit
    rather than Reddit, and so forth. Unsolicited connections must be
    prohibited, and an auto-update mechanism is highly desirable. A readability
    mode and a lightweight, yet functional, ad-blocking system ought to be
    integrated. Moreover, users should have the option to abstain from storing
    browsing history and cache. In the pursuit of seamless integration with
    other system components, consider the merits of employing mpv for video
    playback, employing a clever approach like hint links or context menus, as
    well as utilizing sxiv for image viewing and zathura as a document reader.
    (Note: The feasibility of this integration remains uncertain.) Importantly,
    a browser should refrain from transforming into a video player, crypto
    wallet, game launcher, or language compiler. In this regard, visurf has
    demonstrated commendable progress, as it already possesses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>vi keybinding for mouse-less browsing.</li>
      <li>A minimalist graphical user interface.</li>
      <li>Written in C language.</li>
      <li>Lightweight (need improving) ad-blocking system.</li>
      <li>Keyboard link hints.</li>
      <li>A customizable config file (* a very basic one).</li>
      <li>WIP Gemini support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, despite its virtues, it seems too good to be true. Building
    visurf from source requires a multitude of hefty libraries, including
    cairo, pango, harfbuzz, fribidi, and fontconfig. Additionally, it is solely
    compatible with the Wayland display server.</p>
    <p>Indeed, Qutebrowser, as it stands today, encompasses most of these
    features and more, provided one invests the time to customize its
    configuration file. It is a testament to Qutebrowser's brilliance that it
    offers an extensive range of functionalities even without the need for
    addons or extensions.</p>
