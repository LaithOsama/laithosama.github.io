    <p>This is my three-year journey into the world of "Free and Open Source
    Software" (FOSS). I explored various programs and discovered their hidden
    treasures. These programs, embody the simplicity and functionality. Their
    brilliance remains untarnished, unblemished by the superficial allure of
    utilitarian capitalism. Instead, they were born out of pure intention and
    sincere dedication, transforming mundane pieces of plastic into invaluable
    tools that serve their users with unparalleled efficiency.</p>
    <p>In their existence, these programs bear the noble responsibility of
    redirecting the trajectory of software development, guiding it back onto
    the path of progress, with a wary eye toward the perils of undue
    complexity. A stark contrast emerges when compared to their counterparts,
    whose arduous evolution breeds a regrettable cycle of mounting intricacies
    and insatiable demands for computational resources.</p>
    <p>Amidst my admiration for these remarkable creations, I must implore you
    to embrace a vital caveat-an admonition to approach this technology with
    temperance and discernment. Let us not succumb to an excessive reliance,
    but instead wield it judiciously and purposefully. With enlightened
    guidance, we possess the power to transform this technology from a
    potential adversary into a steadfast ally. By harnessing its vast
    capabilities, we can propel our endeavors forward, enrich our lives, and
    foster a newfound independence from the shackles of the modern world order
    and industrial society.</p>
    <h2>The distribution</h2>
    <p>Regarding Linux distributions, I have tried several over the course of
    two years. Mint, Lubuntu, Kubuntu, Opensuse, Fedora, Arch and Artix. I
    favored Arch/Artix, but then I discovered <a href=
    "https://www.voidlinux.org">Void Linux</a>. Ah, what a wondrous distro it
    was, surpassing all that came before!. After a year of using, I felt
    ashamed for using a distro led by some random nigger-tranny-faggot. Also, Void
    Linux proved to be excessive for my simple needs, with its intricate
    complexities impeding my ability to exercise complete control over its core
    parts.<br />
    And so, my quest for stability and harmony propelled me towards Oasis and
    KISS Linux, beckoning me towards new horizons of possibility. Kiss, with
    its simplicity and meticulously crafted design, bestowed upon its users
    unparalleled dominion over every constituent aspect. However, amidst this
    pursuit, I encountered Oasis, a true marvel of extraordinary beauty and
    unbounded astonishment. Its essence transcended the confines of mere
    perfection, encapsulating the essence of genius within its meticulously
    orchestrated design.</p>
    <p>Throughout this journey, I realized that exploring many different
    distributions is a such waste of time. Many of them have marred by foolish
    and convoluted design choices, have strayed far from their original
    purpose, succumbing to the allure of emulating the Windows Look/Feel. As
    for the remaining few, they bear a striking resemblance to one another,
    their distinctions fading into obscurity.</p>
    <p>However, amidst this sea of mediocrity, a select few distributions have
    emerged as beacons of hope, worthy of our attention and exploration. Such
    as "Void Linux", "Alpine Linux", "KISS Linux" and "Oasis Linux".</p>
    <h2>Display server</h2>
    <p>When it comes to display servers, I have embraced both Wayland and
    Framebuffer. Within Wayland, I use wld, swc, velox, st, and dmenu, each
    fulfilling a unique purpose. In the embrace the Framebuffer, I am
    accompanied by fbpad, fbff, fbpdf, and more, tools that illuminate my
    path.</p>
    <h2>Desktop environment</h2>
    <p>Ah, the tumultuous realm of Desktop Environments! A tempestuous
    landscape of instability and bloated excess. Even Windows itself is lighter
    and more stable compared to many Desktop Environments I encountered during
    my journey. Thus, I wandered between Windows and Linux, until the fateful
    encounter with xfce4, a sanctuary of stability amidst chaos. It stands as a
    shining example of a Desktop Environment, perchance the pinnacle of its
    kind. Yet, even in the midst of this discovery, a longing persisted within
    me, until I found dwm. Perfect, unyielding, and free from the shackles of
    bugs that plagued others (FUCK YOU KDE), dwm emerged as the epitome of
    speed and stability. It graced my ancient 12-year-old laptop with
    unwavering grace, a testament to its impeccable codebase. With kernel,
    services, and a terminal window, I marveled at a 30MB
    RAM consumption. Later, I realized, that the surplus of features and
    conveniences within the meticulously curated system I once embraced.
    It became apparent that many of these features were no longer essential,
    and I found myself capable of relinquishing their gasp. 
    A weariness settled within me, weary of expending precious time on
    trivialities solely to satisfy aesthetic inclinations (ricing).
    In Light of this revelation, I harbored no hesitation in transitioning
    from Xorg for Wayland and embracing velox, recognizing its capacity to
    streamline my endeavors and restore focus to what truly matters.

    <h2>The utils</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Terminal: <a href="https://st.suckless.org/">st</a>, having bad times
      here as a BiDi user. However I use it in wayland using this <a href=
      "https://github.com/michaelforney/st">port</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Web browser: chromium (ungoogled). Based on my vast experience, I
      dare assert that chromium, in its fastness and lightness,
      outshines the very fabric of Firefox.. It also shall be written better then
      firefox.</li>
      <li>Video player: mpv, It's a powerful video player, it can be configured
      to consume the least of CPUs, also I use it as audio player and image
      viewer. I use Fbff to play short videos in Framebuffer, it use
      way less ram then mpv.</li>
      <li>Editor: Neatvi/Vis, both are vi clones, They exude minimalism and
      usability, surpassing their forebears in elegance and functionality.</li>
      <li>RSS Reader: sfeed, the based way to read RSS.</li>
      <li>Docs Reader: embracing Mupdf in Xorg/Wayland, Fbpdf in
      Framebuffer.</li>
    </ul>
