    <p>In the realm of social media platforms, a lamentable truth reveals
    itself-a lack of true freedom of expression. For these digital domains,
    nestled within the embrace of neo-liberal and capitalist entities, share a
    common ideology that stifles dissenting voices. Any opinion that dares to
    oppose the tenets of neo-liberalism is swiftly eradicated, be it of a
    political or social nature, or even a mere questioning of their
    foundations.</p>
    <p>Bearing witness to this phenomenon, we find behemoths like Facebook and
    Google, amassing our personal data with a voracious appetite, capable of
    bartering it to governments and organizations. They wield an unsettling
    omniscience, rendering traditional intelligence services obsolete. The
    implications for our social, national, and geo-political security are
    grave, particularly for those who challenge the foundations of this modern
    world. Perhaps you, dear interlocutor, are perceived as inconsequential, a
    mere sub-human, rendering your information valueless. Yet, let us not
    forget that such information and data serve as the bedrock of controlling
    entire populations. By surrendering our data, we unwittingly empower them
    to subjugate our people.</p>
    <p>Within the tapestry of our mortal existence, lies an indelible truth-an
    obligation, even. Death beckons us, whispering of the importance of leaving
    a lasting legacy behind. Consider a tome of wisdom or a digital domain, a
    website replete with memoirs and thought-provoking articles. Let the echoes
    of your voice resonate beyond the confines of mortality.</p><br />
    <h2>Learn HTML and CSS basics</h2>
    <p>To embark upon the path of web creation, first, acquaint yourself with
    the essentials of HTML and CSS. Begin by selecting a venerable text editor.
    Personally, I find solace in the embrace of <a href=
    "https://github.com/martanne/vis&quot;">Vis</a> for programming and
    <a href="https://github.com/aligrudi/neatvi">Neatvi</a> for writing you may
    opt for <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim.git">Vim</a>/<a href=
    "https://neovim.io">Neovim</a>, available in Linux, Windows and MacOS.
    However, DO NOT USE VSCODE!</p>
    <p>Those two videos helped me build the initial structure of my blog:
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJadKSKA7Mg&amp;t=6s">Luke Smith's
    video</a> (this may be enough to build a simple personal website) Following
    that by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlxWf493en4">FreeCompCode
    video</a> (Her voice is unbeatable lol).</p>
    <p>Now to summarize how HTML works - everything is a component. You start
    it with &lt;component&gt;, add the contents (text, images, whatever) and
    then end it with &lt;/component&gt;.<br />
    your final result must be something like this:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;<b>Your website title, or basically the text showing in the browser tab</b>&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;

        &lt;main&gt;
            <b>&lt;!--  CONTENT GOES HERE  --&gt;

            &lt;!--  CONTENT ENDS HERE --&gt;</b>
        &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre><br />
    * Keep in mind, you can take inspiration from existing websites, you can
    browse HTML and CSS of any website in any browser.<br />
    <h2>Upload the Website</h2>
    <p>Embark upon a journey to create a <a href=
    "https://github.com">Github</a> account, then create a repo and name it
    "USERNAME.github.io" and check "Add a README file" box.<br />
    upload index.html and all its companions-unto the repository.<br />
    Finally, enter "USERNAME.github.io". and BOOM, Your website ascends to the
    digital firmament, now accessible to all, free of charge.</p>
