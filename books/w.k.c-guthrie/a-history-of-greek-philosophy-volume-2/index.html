       The device on the cover is from a coin of Clagomenae, the
       birthplace of Anaxagoras, of Roman Imperial date. It
       shows the philosopher holding a globe, recalling perfaps
       the saying attributed to him that the study of the heavens
       and the whole universe is what makes life worth while
       (see p. 269 n. 2).

<h1>PREFACE</h1>
<p>The phrase <em> Presocratic tradition’ is chosen for the title of this volume,
rather than </em>Presocratic philosophers’, in acknowledgment of the fact
that not all those included are Presocratic in the literal sense. (The
main purpose of chapter vi is to bring home this point.) We shall
continue to follow a line or family of philosophers who were interested
in the same things and could meet on common ground to fight their
intellectual battles, each trying to correct or refine on the views of the
others on the same subject. Many of them were known in antiquity
as the physical or natural philosophers, and I considered using this
description in the title; but natural philosophy can hardly be stretched
to cover the True Way of Parmenides or the paradoxes of Zeno, and
their common interest can best be described as an investigation into
the nature of reality and its relation to sensible phenomena. Man was
not excluded from their surveys, but in both his individual and his
social aspects was treated rather as an appendage to evolutionary
theories of cosmogony.     So far as modern terms are applicable, they
dealt in physical and social anthropology rather than in ethics or
politics. Others meanwhile were making man the centre of their study,
and with his cosmic setting as background          only, were   laying the
foundations of European moral and political theory.         Since the two
types of thinker were contemporaneous,        and acquainted with each
others’ work, there could be no impenetrable barriers between them,
and so we find Democritus, a physikos if ever there was one, also writing
on ethical and political matters, though his expounders (perhaps wisely)
concentrated on the atomic theory of the real world as his main achieve-
ment. Conversely the humanists made full use of current scientific
theories as a basis for their teaching on the nature and behaviour of
man. Yet on the whole they pursued fundamentally different aims, the
‘Presocratics” seeking the advancement of knowledge for its own sake,
and the Sophists and Socrates trying in different ways to discover and
pursue the best life. [talian philosophers like the Pythagoreans and
Empedocles also, it is true, preached a way of life, but it was one which
                                 xiil
<p>                                         Preface
could only be attained through an understanding of the cosmos, and
its essentially religious character had nothing in common with the
sceptical outlook of the Sophists. The fact that Empedocles was one
of the leading politicians of his city finds little reflexion in his poems.
The humanism which was developing side by side with the continnance
of metaphysical and early scientific theory in the fifth century is here
put aside, to be taken up in the next volume.
I am grateful to the reviewers of volume 1 hoth for the generous
<p>welcomne which         they gave it, and also for some                  highly pertinent
criticisms.    One of these touches on a point which has                      éxercised me
considerably, namely the order of exposition. T have kept to a chrono-
logical order of philosophers, dealing with each as a completk individual
before passing to the next. There is much to be said for the method
which my critic (and doubtless others) would prefer, of dividing by
 topics, following each separate problem or group of problems-—the
physis of things, the source of motion, cesmogony, the origins of life
—as it was developed by successive thinkers throughout the period.
 The difficulty about this method is that none of the problems ate in
fact separate. The conclusions of these men about the ultimate con-
stitution of things, the cause of motion or the nature of the soul were
intimately connected and affected their pronouncements on every other
topic as well. Each presents us with a system marvellously coherent
down to its smallest details, It is indeed easy to see how a man’s ideas
on the “first principles’ of matter can affect what he has to say about
cosmogony, cosmology and astronomy;* but some may think that at
least minor topics like magnetism or the sterility of mules (which
seems to have exercised a disproportionate fascination over our philo~
sophers or those who reported them) could have been separated from
the large metaphysical or cosmic speculations, a procedure which
would have undoubted advantages for those who wish to refer quickly
or conveniently to a compendium of ancient views on this or that
aspect of natural science. Yet even that is not so.
This has not been my sole motive. In honesty 1 must confess that

I am more interested in people than in theoties, in philosophers than
in philosophy. This, I hope, does not mean paying less attention to the
development of ideas, but it does mean a preference for presenting the
bearers of these ideas as individual characters, which, I should claim,
even the unsatisfactory nature of our information permits us to see that
they were. Their philosophies are the outcome of contrasting tempera-
ments (as, perhaps, are all philosophies), and it is this human interest
which I have tried above all things 10 bring out. In no one is it more
vividly displayed than in Empedocles, and for that reason I have said
a little more on this topic in introducing him (pp. 122f.). As a second
best for those readers whose interest lies primarily in the other direction,
1 have provided a fairly extensive table of contents, and also tried to
make the index a means of finding out, as quickly as possible, the kind
of information on the development of separate topics which would
have been more easily available had the book been written the other
way round. For this reason I have chosen to draw it up myself, and
must bear the responsibility for any shortcomings in it.
We cannot remind ourselves too often of the difference between
<p>philosophy as it was understood in the period here treated, and as it is
most often understood today, at least in our own country. This we
may briefly do with the aid of two definitions, a modern and an
ancient. The first was uttered in 196a: ‘There is now a fair measure of
agreement among philosophers that theirs is what is technically called
a second-order subject. They do not set out to describe, or even to
explain, the world, still less to change it. Their concern is only with
the way in which we speak ahout the world. Philosophy, it has been
said, is talk about talk.” Set beside this a pronouncement of the first
century B.C.: ‘Philosophy, to interpret the word, is nothing else but
the pursuit of wisdom; and wisdom, as the old philosophers defined it,
consists in a knowledge of things divine and human, and of the causes
by which these things are maintained.”</p>

contains testimonia, that is, accounts in later Greek authorities of the
philosopher’s life and doctrines, or paraphrases of his writings; in

genuine quotations from the philosopher himsel%’. In this book the
number of a ‘B’ passage is normally preceded by ‘fr.” (fragment),

              NOTE        ON     THE       SOURCES</p>
</p>
<p>The meagreness of our inheritance of original works of the Greek
philosophers is commented on in Volume 1 (24f). For the Pre-
socratics in particular we depend on excerpts, summaries and comments
made by later writers. The problems to which this gives rise have
always been recognized, and adequate accounts of the nature of the
sources are available in several works, of which the best and most
accessible is that of G. S. Kirk in KR, 1—7. (Others will be found in
Ueberweg~Praechter, 1026, Zeller, Outlines, 4-8, Burnet, EGP, 31-8.)
In view of this T am making no attempt at a general appraisal at the
beginning, but shall rather deal with particular source-problems as
they arise over individual thinkers. (For the all-important Aristotle
see especially Volume 1, pp. 41-3.) But a certain amount must be briefly
repeated here in order to make intelligible such references as will be
necessary to ‘Aét.’, ‘the Placita’, ‘Plut. Strom.’ or ‘Stob. Ecl.
Theophrastus the pupil of Aristotle wrote a general history of earlier
<p>philosophy and special works on some individual Presocratics. Only
extracts survive, though they include the greater part of the book On
Sensation. These works of Theophrastus formed the main foundation
for what is known as the doxographical tradition, which took different
forms: “opinions’ arranged according to subjects, biographies, or
somewhat artificial ‘successions’ (S1aBoyat) of philosophers regarded
as master and pupil.
The classification of the doxographical material was undertaken in
<p>the monumental work of Hermann Diels, Doxographi Graeci (Berlin,
1879), to which all subsequent researchers into Presocratic philosophy
owe an incalculable debt. The collections of the works of the early
thinkers were known as 86§ (‘opinions’, hence ‘doxography’) or
T&amp; &amp;péoxovta (Latinized as Placita). There are two such collections or
summaries extant, the Epitome falsely claimed as Plutarch’s, and the
Physical Extracts (puoikal &amp;doyat) appearing in the Anrhology or
Florilegium of “ Stobaeus’ (John of Stobi, probably fifth century a.n.).
From a reference in the Christian bishop Theodoret (first half of fifth
                               xvii
<p>                              Note on the Sources
century) it is known that both of these go back to a certain A&amp;tius,
and the two are printed by Diels in parallel colurnns as the Placita of
Agtius. Agtius himself, who is otherwise unknown, was probably of
the second century A.D.
Berween Theophrastus and Agtius was a Stoic summary, of the first
<p>century B.C. at the latest, which can be detected behind doxographical ac-
countsin Varro and Cicero, and was named by Diels the Vesusta Placiza.
The doxographies in Hippolytus’s Refutation of al] Heresies, and the
<p>pseudo-Plutarchean Stromateis (‘Miscellanies’) preserved ir‘ Eusebius,
appear to be independent of Aé&amp;tius.
  The Lives of the Philosophers by Diogenes Laertius K\probably
third century A.D.) exists entire, and contains matter fromh                      various
Hellenistic squrces of uneven value.
  To sum up, our information about the Presocratic philosophers
depends first of all on extracts or quotations from their works which
range from one brief sentence in the case of Anaximander (and of
Anaximenes perhaps not even that) to practically the whole of the
True Way of Parmenides. Secondly we have occasional mention and
discussion of Presocratic thought in Plato, and a more systematic
exposition and criticism in Aristotle. Finally there is the post-
Aristotelian information which (with a few exceptions which will be
mentioned in discussing the sources for particular philosophers)
depends on brief, and sometimes garbled, epitomes of the wotk of
Theophrastus, the distortions frequently taking the form of adaptation
to Stoic thought. To see through this veil to the mind of archaic
Greece is the primary task of Presocratic scholarship. Whether it is
worth while no one had a better right to say than Hermann Diels, who
at the end of his life declared, in a posthumously published lecture:
‘I count myself fortunate in that it has been vouchsafed to me to
dedicate the best part of my powers to the Presocratics.™
For further details readers are referred to the account of Kirk
<p>mentioned above.         In addition, an appraisal of the historical work of
Theophrastus, which does him more justice than earlier accounts, is

                            A.   PARMENIDES
</p>
                             (1) Date and life
<p>Presocratic philosophy is divided into two halves by the name of
Parmenides. His exceptional powers of reasoning brought speculation
about the origin and constitution of the universe to a halt, and caused
it to make a fresh start on different lines. Consequently his chrono-
logical position relative to other early philosophers is comparatively
easy to determine. Whether or not be directly attacked Heraclitus,!
had Heraclitus known of Parmenides it is incredible that he would not
have denounced him along with Xenophanes and others. Even if
ignorance of an Elean on the part of an Ephesian is no sure evidence of
date, philosophically Heraclitus must be regarded as pre-Parmenidean,
whereas Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Leucippus and Democritus are
equally certainly post-Parmenidean.
His approximate date is given by Plato in his dialogue Parmenides,
<p>when he describes       a meeting         between        Parmenides      and   Socrates
(1272—&lt;):
Zeno and Parmenides once came to Athens for the Great Panathenaea.
_Parmenides was well advanced in years, about sixty-five, quite grey-haired,
and of distinguished appearanice, and Zeno was nearly forty.. ..Socrates at
the time was very young.
  1t would seem from this that Parmenides was forty or more years
<p> older than Socrates, who could hardly be described as ‘very young’
"unless he was under twenty-five. Since Socrates was born in 470/69,
 this puts the birth of Parmenides at approximately 515-10.
  It is true that Diogenes Laertius (9.23) gives his floruit as the 6yth
<p> Olympiad (504-~1), which is in conflict with this.                    Burnet however
justly draws attention in this connexion to the mechanical methods of
                 * See vol. 1, 408 n. 2 and pp. 23ff.,, 32 below.

Apollodorus on whom Diogenes relied. It is likely that, as with
Xenophanes, his point of reference was the foundation of Elea, the
supposed floruiz of Xenophanes being assumed as the birth-year of his
‘pupil . Birth and floruis are calculated at forty-year intervals. Similarly
Parmenides’s own pupil Zeno is said to have ‘flourished’ ten Olym-
piads later. As Burnet says, one can attach little importance to such
combinations. Plato on the other hand, whether or not the meeting
between Socrates and Parmenides is historical, had no rejson to give
such exact information about their ages unless he knew it td be correct.?
Itis impossible to say at what age Parmenides wrote his philosophical
<p>poem. In fr. 1.24 he makes the goddess address him as ko is (literally
‘youth’ or ‘young man’). This however indicates no more than his
relationship to her as disciple or recipient of her oracle. In the Birds
of Aristophanes Peisthetairus, who is certainly not a young man, is
addressed by the teller of oracles in the same way.?
By a tradition going back to Plato’s nephew Speusippus, Parmenides
<p>was said to have been a legislator to whom Elea owed some at least of
its laws.3 Theophrastus, and after him later writers, make him a pupil of
Xenophanes, though Aristotle did not commir himself, but reported
only that this was “said to be’ the case (Mezaph. 986 b 22). It is quite
possibly true. Parmenides was much younger, but would have been
about forty when the long-lived Xenophanes died. Both lived in
Magna Graecia, and the influence of Xenophanes’s conception of unity
on Parmenides is clear, whether it came from his writings or from
personal contact.$
 The only other reported fact about his life is that he was at some

politicalactivityon the part of Parmenides as of other Presocratic philosophers, but the cautionary
remarks of Jaeger (Aristotle, Eng, tr. app. 2, 454, 0. 1) should be noted. E. L. Minar (4/P, 1949,
41—55) suspects a connexion between Parmenides’s political views and social position and his
philosophical conceptions of being and seeming,

highty unlikely, though others have thought differently.    (See KR 265.)</p>

<p>                      Life and Writings of Parmenides
tme a Pythagorean.             This is related circumstantially by Diogenes
(r.21):
Though he was a pupil of Xenophanes he did not follow him.                            He also
associated with Ameinias son of Diochaites, the Pythagorean, a poor man
but of fine character, and it was rather Ameinias whose disciple he became.
When he died, Parmenides built a shrine for him, being himself a man of
noble birth and wealth, and it was Ameinias, not Xenophanes, who converted
him to the quiet life.
The otherwise unknown Ameinias is not likely to have been an inven-
tion, and the shrine (fipdov) with its inscription would be a monument
of some permanence and doubtless itself the authority for the fact.
Proclus (in Parm. 1, p. 619.4, DK, A 4) says simply that Parmenides
and his pupil Zeno were ‘both not only Eleans but also members of the
Pythagorean school, as Nicomachus has recorded’. That Parmenides
was at one time an adherent of Pythagoreanism finds some confirmation
in his own work, but he certainly broke away from it, as from all other
previous philosophical systems.</p>
                                    (2) Writings
<p>He wrote in the hexameter metre of Homer and Hesiod, and the poem
was preserved until a late date.               It was available in its entirety to
Simplicius, who quotes it at length for reasons which he states ( Phys.
144.26):
The lines of Parmenides on the One Being are not many, and I should like
to append them to this commentary both as confirmation of what I say and
because of the rarity of the book."
There follows a quotation of fifty-three lines, after which he adds:
‘These then are the lines of Parmenides about the One Being.” One
may assume that on this supremely important topic he has given the
relevant passage complete. Altogether we now possess 154 lines, un-~
evenly distributed. After a prologue of thirty-two lines, the poem is
in two parts, dealing respectively with truth and seeming. Diels
* Diels (ZLekrgedicht, 26) remarks that Simplicius’s copy was excellent, and was probably in
<p>the library of the Academy, though Praclus used a different MS. He adds, without quoting
evidence, that Aristotle's copy was not 50 good as Theophrastus’s. Fr. 16 may be an example of
what he had in mind, but che explanation is probably that Theophrastus was the more careful and
{ess impromptu excerptor.
                                        The Eleatics
estimated that about nine-tenths of the first part has survived, whereas
of the second there are only small scraps amounting to perhaps one-
tenth, Forrunately the first pact is by far the most important, and
Simplicius showed his good sense in ensuring that it at least should go
down to posterity in Parmenides’s own words.
The style of the paem is variable. Of the central ‘ Way of Truth’,
<p>in which he tries to expound the novel and paradoxical doctrine of the
unity of Being and its consequences, the remark of Proclus that it is
“more like prose than poetry’ is if anything an understatement. As he
develops his strictly logical argument, Parmenides is hampered at every
turn, and far more than Lucretius, by the parrii sermonis efrestas.                          One
can fee] the struggle to convey philosophical concepts for which the
expression does not yet exist, and some lines are scarcely amenable to
translation at all. The prologue on the other hand is full of mythical
imagery, and steeped in a religious fervour which it would be unwise to
ignore. The fragments of the ‘Way of Seeming’ also show signs of a
gift for poetic expression.?</p>
</p>
</p>
                                (3) A central problem
<p>The poem of Parmenides raises peculiar problems, and it will be as
well to approach the text with the chief of these already in mind. In
the prologue he receives from a goddess the promise that she will
reveal to him two sorts of information: fiest the truth about reality,
then the opinions of mortals, which are unambiguously said to be false.
‘Nevertheless these too shalt thou learn’ (fr. 1.31).                           In conformity
with this, the first part of the poem deduces the nature of reality from
premises asserted to be wholly true, and leads among other things to
the conclusion thét the world as perceived by the senses is unreal. At
this point (fr. 8.50) the goddess solemnly declares that she ceases to
speak the truth, and the remainder of the instruction will be *deceitful’;
yet she will impart it all ‘that no judgment of men may outstrip thee’.
Then follows the second part of the poem consisting of a cosmology
! To J. Beaufret, the line wxngals mepl yoiav dAduevoy &amp;hAérpiov gidbs was ‘un des plus
<p>beaux vers de Ia langue greeque’ (Le Podme de P., 8). It at least indicates, as Diels pointed out,
that Parmenides had a sense of humour and was not above making a pun.             See p. 66 below.
Adverse criticisms of his style in antiquity are collected by Diels, Lehrgediche, s ff.</p>

<p>                            A Central Problem in Parmenides
  on traditional lines. Starting from the assumption of a pair of opposites,
 ‘fire’ and “night” or light and darkness, it proceeds as a narrative of an
 evolutionary process in time. The ‘true way’, on the other hand, had
 asserted that reality was, and must be, a unity in the strictest sense and
 that any change in it was impossible: there is no before or after, and the
 exposition unfolds as a timeless series of logical deductions.
  Here is the crux. Why should Parmenides take the trouble to narrate
<p> a detailed cosmogony when he has already proved that opposites can-
 not exist and there can be no cosmogony because plurality and change
 are inadmissible conceptions? Has it in his eyes no merit or validity
 whatsoever, so that his purpose in composing it is only to show it up,
 together with all such attempts at cosmogony, for the hollow shams
 that they are? 1f so, the further question arises: what is it? Some have
thought it to be based on a particular cosmic system of which he dis-
approved, for instance that of Heraclitus or the Pythagoreans.* Others
have suggested, following up the goddess’s own words about the
‘opinions of mortals’ in general, that it is partly or wholly intended as
a synthesis of what the ordinary man believed about the world; others
again that it is an original production, indeed the best that Parmenides
could devise, but still intended to show that even the most plausible
 account of the origin and nature of the sensible world is utterly false,
 These critics point to the motive expressed by the goddess, ‘that no
judgment of mortals may outstrip (or get the better of) thee’.
 An alternative is to suppose that Parmenides is doing his best for
<p> the sensible world, perhaps on practical grounds, by giving as coherent
an account of it as he can, saying in effect: I have told you the truth,
so that if T go on to speak about the world in which we apparently
live you will know it is unreal and not be taken in. But after all, this
is how it does appear to us; however misleading our senses may be,
we must eat and drink and talk, avoid putting our hand in the fire or
falling over a precipice, live in short as if their information were
genuine.     Being curselves mortals we must come to terms with this
 ! Specific criticisms of eatlier thinkers in Parmenides, with the possible exception of Hera-
<p>clitus, are not obvious. The efforts of K. Reich to identify Anaximander’s &amp;neipov with non-being,
and to find a reference to Pythagorean doctrines of rebirth in the maMvrpomos kbeuBos of
fr. €.9, cannot be said 1o be successful. On the latter see H. Schwab), 4ny. f. d. Altertumswiss

These are the most bafling problems which Parmenides presents:
<p>the pature of the “Way of Seeming’ and the relation between it and the
“Way of Truth’. Yet the essence of his remarkable achievement lies, as
might be expected, within the Way of Truth itself.</p>

<p>Contrasting Parmenides and Heraclitus, Cornford wx-oteE (P[ato and
Parm. 29): ‘Heraclitus is the prophet of a LZaogos which could only be
expressed in seeming contradictions; Parmenides is the px‘ophet of a
logic which will tolerate no semblance of contradiction.” In this
description both are called prophets. Applied to a logician the term
may sound contradictory, yet it is true that Parmenides was at one with
Heraclitus in claiming a prophetic or apocalyptic authority for his
teaching. He wrote in epic verse, evidently agreeing with Xenophanes
that this medium must not be left to the retailers of scandalous myths.
To live up to his reputation as a teacher, the poet must prove himself
able to write the truth, not malicious fables. But to a Greek the gift
of poetry meant that he was not writing unaided. Other poets had
their Muse. Homer begins by invoking his, and Hesiod tells in circum-
stantial detail how the Muses came and taught him his song as he
pastured his flock beneath Helicon in his native Boeotia. This was not
metaphor, but reflected a genuine belief in an inspiration whereby the
poet is granted deeper insight into the truth than other men. Heraclitus,
writing in prose, had solemnly claimed to be uttering a truth that
* Some may think the following account of the prologue is superficial and ignores difficulties
<p>of demail. A full treatment will be found in J. Mansfeld, Offenbarung des Parmenides, ch, 4. To
treat it at such length js impossible here, and in any case a reading of Mansfeld, as of some other
scholars, has made me doubt whether in fact the atrempt to press all the details of Parmenides’s
mysterious journey and force them into literal consistence is legitimate.       Certainly some of
Mansfeld’s interpretations are highly speculative, e.g. the idea that €85 in v, 3 implies that
Parmenides has already received his revelation from the goddess and therefore is on his way 8ack
{on which Mansfeld bases a great deal), or the claim to see a connexion between the Advos olbés
of v, 12 and the ‘sohd wall® of the universe in A37. His book is a thorough and independent
piece of work, and a treasury of the resultsof previousscholarship,   for which a reader maybe con-
fidently referred to ic. It is indispensable to a serious studenc af Parmenides, especially perhaps
for its concern 1o determine what in later terminologyare the logical forms of thearguments which
he was already capable of using. But each must go his own way. The approach here is different,
and I have not attempted to note all the places in which I have thought differently from Mansfeld.</p>

<p>                           The Prologue of Parmenides
endures for ever. When in the introductory lines of his poem Par-
menides announces that what he has to say was revealed to him by a
goddess after a magical journey through the gates of Day and Night,
he is making a similar claim in the poet’s traditional manner.
The prologue, which we owe in the main not to Simplicius but to
<p>Sextus, may be translated as fallows:!
The mares that carry me as far as my heart ever aspires sped me on, when
they had brought and set me on the far-famed road of the god {i.e. the Sun],
which bears the man of knowledge over all cities. On that road was I borne,

Several scholars have recognized that Parmenides sees himself as travelling through the sky in
the Sun’s chariot, as is indeed sufficiently obvious. Like Phaethon he has the Sun’s daughters as
guides and charioieers (vv, 9, 24), the axle i blazing (v, 7), the starting-pomt js the house of
Night (. 9; see esp. Bowra, CP, 1937, 103f). It 15 all the more strange that so few have made
the identification given above.    (Sextus in hus paraphrase gives the mase      article to Baliovos,
though one cannot be certain what god he had 10 mind.)      As Frankel noted, the relative pronoun
could go equally well with 886v or Saduovos (p. ciz. 160). I do not know why Parmenides made
the steeds mares (they are masc. 1n Pindar, O/ 7.71), but this need not affect the identification.

Burnet and Jaeger took them to mean that Parmenides’s way led chrough all cities, which caused

having left the house of Night, hastened to escart me.” This need not however imply the remark-
able idea that the mares made the first part of the journey on their own, without drivers.
. 10. Some see symbolic significance in the casting back of the veils, and Bowra ‘a detail indi~
<p>carive of almost indecent haste, which surely comes from some old story’. But it may be no
more than a vague Homeric echo: the prologue is full of such. Nausicaa and her maidens play

There are the gates of the paths of Night and Day, set between a lintel and
<p>a threshold of stone. They themselves, high in the sky, are blocked with
great doors, of which avenging Justice holds the alternate keys.                           Her the
maidens beguiled with soft words, and skilfully persuaded her to push back
swiftly for them the bolted bar from the gates. The doors flew back and
revealed the wide opening between their leaves, swinging in turn in their
sockets the bronze-bound pivots made fast with dowels and rivets. Straight
through them the maidens kept the chariot and horses on the highway.
v. 34. duoi1pols by itself need only mean that the “keys” alternately open and shut the gates, or
<p>alternatively that they cross one another. In epic Greek wAmyibes were either bars put across the
leaves of a door to shut it (e.g. /. 12.455) or hooks with which the bar could be reached from
the outside in order to move it (as in Od. 21.47). The present phrase can hardly be unconnected
in sense with the dxfies trnpoiBol of JZ x2.455£, and the ¥inls may be identical with the &amp;xels
removed by Dike in v. 16, &amp;e would then bear the meaning *has charge of’, as the Horae have
charge of the gates of heaven in Homer (/. 5.749).

 The essential features of the prologue are these.                               Parmenides is
<p>privileged above other mortals. Like a more fortunate Phaethon, he is
borne through the sky in the sun-chariot with the Sun’s daughters to
drive him. The journey is not natrated stage by stage, but the key-
points are brought out in an impressionistic manner. It is a journey
from Night to Day. Where these meet is a formidable barrier, the
importance of which is emphasized by dwelling on the details of its
construction, a gate guarded by the figure of justice. None may pass
without her permission, that is, unless his passage is sanctioned by
right and by divine consent.
                                         The Eleatics
Once through the gate, the road leads straight to the house of an
<p>unnemed goddess, probably not immediately since Parmenides speaks
of continuing steaight along the carriage-way (dua€itds); but we can-
not say how far, for he wastes no time over inessentials, but simply
throws a spotlight on the critical points in the journey. The goddess
confirms his right to be there, and promises to teach him “all things’,
both the truth and what is falsely believed by mortals.
This narrative plainly gives to what follows it the character of a
<p>divine revelation, but to determine how seriously Parmerg‘ides believed
in this is not easy.! The mythical elements of the prologv.f are for the
most part traditional. Much of the phraseology is borrowed from
Homer and Hesiod.® The goddess who instructs the poet corresponds
to the Muse of the epic writers, who may also be addressed as ‘goddess’,
as in the opening line of the Jliad: ‘Sing, goddess, of the wrath.” When
at the beginning of the catalogue of ships Homer invokes the Muses to
aid him, he adds (7. 2.485): ‘for you are goddesses, and are present
and know all things’. Hesiod was taught his song by the Muses as he
pastured his sheep under Helicon, and it is noteworthy that they said
to him (Theog. 27£): “We know how to say many false things re-
sembling true, and we know how to utter the truth when we wish.’
Parmenides was under the influence of an old tradition, though he
turned it to novel ends, when he told of the goddess saying that she
would teach bim both the truth and what seems true but is not, There
are also hints that he was acquainted with the Orphic poems,’ but

HSCP, 1958, that the journey of Odyssens 1s the primary model, and that this Odyssey morifis
continued in the philosophical parts of the poem. Naturally he agrees that the horses and chariot
belong to a different set of associations (the woAigpaoTor frmwos of v. 4 are the horses of Achilles, a
suggestion first made by Diels), but this does not seem to him so big an exception as it may ta
others. Parallels with the Qdyssey are also drawn by Mansfeld, Ofenbarung, 230.

on this point Gruppe, Rhaps. Theog. 708; Dieterich K/, Schr. p12£.; Kern, De theagoniiz, 52,
Later in the poem the contemptuous dismissal of mortals at fr. 6. 4. looks like a reministence
of Orph. fr. 233. Both in Parmenides and the Orphic writer the raling at mortals is pnmanly
directed against their ignorance. Hence elbéta g@Ta in v, 3 probably carries jts overtones of
eeligious snitfation, (For exx. see Bowra, 109.) One may compare also the light which s
granted to Eleusinian initiares in the next world and is one of theiv chief joys (Ar, Frogs, 455L).

<p>                          Parmenides and Shamanism
all these echoes are on a verbal level and demonstrate no more than that
Patmenides was steeped in the tradition of older and contemporary
poetry. (Bowra quotes similar images in Pindar, Bacchylides, Simon-
ides and others.) There is for instance no hint in his teaching that he
subsczibed to the characteristic Orphic doctrines. The general character
of the prologue points rather to the (of course not unrelated) ‘shaman-
fstic” strain in early Greek religious thought, represented by semi-
legendary figures like Aithalides, Aristeas, Abaris, Epimenides and
Hermotimus. Of Aithalides it was said that he had from Hermes the
gift that his psyche could travel now in Hades and now above the earth
(Pherecydes, fr. 8 DK). Aristeas made similar magical journeys and
could appear in two places at once (Hdt. 4.131L), and the soul of
Hermotimus was accustomed to leave his body lying and wander alone
in search of knowledge (Pliny, N.H. 7.174).                          Epimenides while his
body slept encountered the goddesses Truth and Justice (Epim. fr. 1
DK ad fin.), which brings his experience close to that of Parmenides.
What is here described reads like a similar spiritual journey ‘above
<p>the earth’ with knowledge as its goal. The resemblance of such a
journey to those of the shamans of Siberia and elsewhere was noted
long ago by Diels, and the increase in comparative material since his
time has only strengthened the resemblance.’ They too can project
their souls on spiritual journeys, sometimes through the sky, during
which they acquire superhuman knowledge.
In this religious and apocalyptic tradition Parmenides has chosen to
<p>set the implacable logic which occupied the heart of his poem. He was
a native of South Italy, where mystical religion was at home, and almost
  <em> Diels, Lehrgedicht, 14, referring to Radloff, dus Sibirien, 11, 3 . Parmenides’s vision is again
related to shaman-poetry by K. Meuli in Hermes, 1935, 171£. In Gks and Irrational, ch. 5, Dodds
makes out a case for actual historical contact, through trade and colonization, berween the Greeks
and the shamenistic cultures centred in Siberia.
On shamanistic journeys in general see Norah K. Chadwick’s Poetry and Prophecy, of which
<p>the last chapter (</p>
</em>The Spiritual Journeys of the Shamans”) emphasizes their universality. Note
also that among the principal themes are journeys “to the hright Heavens above’ as well as to the
underworld, and that ‘in these expeditions the men generally require the help of supernatural
beings, especially supernatural women’.    (C. the Heliades.) W. Burkert (Weisheit u. Wiss. 140)
brings forward evidence for his belief that * shamanistic practices seem 10 have been sull current
in S, Italy of the 6th cenmury B.c.’ Perhaps, however, Eliade’s work on Shamanism (since 1064
available in a revised English edition) should caution us against too free a use of the term with
refetence 1o Greek practice or belief. See the section on shamanistic ideologies and techniques

certainly a Pythagorean; and Pythagoras was believed to have been a
reincarnation of both Aithalides and Hermotimus (D.L. 8.4-5; DK
14.8). One cannot doubt that the prologue describes a genuine
experience. As a mere literary device nothing could be more unsuited
to the main content of the poem, which would have been much better
conveyed in the plain prose of an Anaximenes or an Anaxagoras.
Clearly, however, Parmenides was not a rationalist of the Ionian type,
and it is extraordinarily difficult, at the immense spiritual distance from
which we contemplate his remains, to know how much eight should
be given to the non-rational element in his writings. Like other figures
of archaic Greece, he achieved an outstanding imelleétual advance
within a framework of almost primitive irrationality. How far had he
freed himself from it? Bowra points out (op. cit. 98) that whereas his
predecessors had believed in the reality of the mythical apparatus (e.g.
Epimenides believed his converse with gods in the Dictaean Cave to
be a literal fact), ‘Parmenides is plainly allegorizing’. The gates and
the paths of Night and Day are conflated from Hesiod and the Odyssey,!
but for him the journey through the gates from Night to Day repre-
sents a progress from ignorance to the knowledge or truth which awaits
him on the other side, The road (484) is a widespread poetical image,
but for Parmenides, who carries it right through the poem, it is allegor-
ized as a ‘road of inquity’. The right path (xéheuBios) follows truth,
10 go wrong is to follow ‘an indiscernible track’ (drapmés). Thus he
‘used certain ideas and images which were familiar to his time, but he
used them for a new purpose, and especially he narrowed their applica-
tion to his own sphete of the search for knowledge’ (ibid. 112).
Yet while agreeing with Bowra that Parmenides’s use of allegory
<p>must have been conscious and deliberate, we must not forget the extent
to which, even in those passages which display it, the ground had been
prepared in the pre-philosophical past. The spiritual odyssey of the
shaman had always been a search for knowledge. The equation ‘road
or journey =quest for knowledge=lay or narrative conveying the
results of that quest’ was not his own, but already present in the
  <em> Hes. Th. 748 speaks of Night and Day greeting each other as they cross the great bronze

<p>                  Parmenides: Significance of the Prologue
shamanistic practices of which his poem contains distinct though far-
off echoes."
This religious ancestry, and the extent to which it was a living force
<p>for Parmenides, must then be borne in mind throughout, but not
exaggerated. He put his philosophy in the mouth of a goddess, through
a prologue containing elements taken from eaclier religious poetry and
in some cases traceable to a shamanistic origin; but he is not to be
summed up as ‘a psychologically unstable person who has received a
call 1o the religious life’.</p>
</p>
</em> A few quotations from Bowra’s article
probably bring us as near to the truth as we can get. Parmenides
‘writes nat as a mere logician bur as one whao has had a very special
experience similar to that of those who have consorted with the gods’.
He ‘regarded the search for truth as something akin to the experience
of mystics, and he wrote of it with symbols taken from religion because
he felt that it was itself a religious activity”. At the same time the pro-
logue is not 10 be explained solely by its origins: ‘Parmenides is
plainly allegorizing. The allegory may of course be based on some-
thing akin to a mystical experience, but it is none the less an allegory.
... Parmenides is not giving the literal record of a spiritual adventure
but clothing his search for truth in allegorical dress.” If these statements
seem to display some inconsistency, it is probably an inconsistency in-
herent in the philosopher’s own mind, in the tension between an
inherited and still valid pattern of thought and his own revolutionary
intelleceual vigour.?</p>

<p>olsc #amv ta mean ‘it does occur that something is not’, i.e. there is, besides what is, a non-
existent This he thinks is shown by 6,1, wluch he wanslates, following Diels: *One must say
and think that <only) that which 15, is: for there is beiag, but there s aot not-being (das
Nichiseiende).”   So understood this first false way brings wath it becoming and perishing, loco~
motian, and change. It is the way of the generality of men, The second falselway nientioned in
fr. 6 is the way of the Heracliteans. This interpretation seems woreh men?onmg, but is im~
probable,   Aparr from the translathon of 6.1 (for which see next note), Kranz does not in his
article translase the second half of 1.5. It is of course translated without comment in DK (“dass
NICHT 15T ést, und dass Nichtsein erforderlich ist”), but taken as a whole hig             rendering seems
forced and unnamural,                                                                 \\

   The translation of fr. 3 follows Zeller and Burnet. The infinitive has its original dative force,
and the meaning is hterally *the same thing is for thinking and for being’, an exactly parallet
construction to elov vofioa 10 2.2. This justifies also the rendenng of        6.1 as It s necessary that
what 15 for speaking and thinking should be’, i.e. “What can be spoken and thought about must
be’. See Burnet, EGP, 173, n. 2. [ still think this the most probable translation, even if Burnet's
specific argument that the bare infinitive could not be the subject of a sentence is not conclusive.
(On that point see Heidel, Proc. Am. Ae. 1913, 720, and Verdenius, Parm. 34£)                   It does not
(like Holscher’s version criticized by Mansfeld, Offentarung, 63) involve the incongruity of taking
voev as passive and elvea as active (if it is right 1o speak in these terms when elves is not a transitive
verb), Mansfeld’s preferred Ganslation (* Denn Denken und Sein sind dasselbe”) turns our 1o
mean much the same. It does not, he says, imply (as ane would suppase) che idenuty of Thought
and Being, but only that ‘the object of thought is at the same time the subject of being” (op. cit.
67); or as he puts it an p. tor, with what seems ro me doubrful logic: * Das Seiende ist der einzige
Gegenstand des Denkens, das einzig Denkbare. Deshalb sind Sein und Denken identisch.’ (My
italies.)

     The subject of the verb ‘is’ is not expressly named.                                  It has most
commonly been taken to be ‘what is’, i.e. Parmerudes is uttering a
logical tautology: what is, is. So for instance Diels and Cornford.
Burnet construed it as body or corporeality: ‘ The assertion that ir is
amounts just to this, that the universe is a plenum.” This conclusion is,
as Raven justly remarks, ‘at least premature’, Verdenius suggested ‘all
that exists, the total of things’, again perhaps prematurely.” Others
have thought it wrong to look for any subject. ‘At this early stage in
his poem Parmenides’s premise £om (it is) has no definite subject at
all’ So Raven and Frinkel suggested that the verb s ‘is primarily
used by Parmenides as a so-called impersonal, somewhat like “it

rains”, “raining takes place”’. To this Professor Owen has pertin-
ently objected that something more definite must be intended ‘becanse
Parmenides goes on to prove various characteristics of the subject of
his #o1’.     Owen’s own solution is that ‘what is declared to exist is
simply what can be talked or thought about’, and is actually mentioned,
not here in fr. 2, but in fr. 6.1: “What can be spoken and thought about
must be.”
   Thus the serious choice of subject lies between ‘what is’ and ‘what
can be talked and thought about’.               In one way it does nat seem serious,
for Parmenides in any case identifies the two, and according to Owen
himself, ‘no one will deny that, as the argument goes, 7 2év [what is)
is a correct description of the subject’, His objection to taking it as the
unexpressed subject itself is the logical one that ‘it turns the is into a
mere tautology, and the is not correspondingly into a flat contradiction,
whereas Parmenides thinks it necessary to argue for is and against is
not’. He does not assume it from the start.
   In saying that something is, Parmenides undoubtedly had in mind
what can be ralked and thought about, since he explicitly identifies the
two. That then is a correct description of the subject, as also is “what
is’. Nevertheless it does not seem quite fair to scholars such as Corn-
ford, who suppose that in fr. 2 he is saying simply ‘what is, is’, to
object either that they are unaware that a tantology is incapable of
proof, or that they accuse Parmenides of failing to see this simple point.
   The history of Greek thought up to his time may allow a different
view, for the polemical character of the poem is unquestioned. Later
he argues with devastating precision that once one has said that some-
thing is, one is debarred from saying that it was or will de, of attributing
to it an origin or a dissolution in time, or any alteration or motjon
whatsoever. But this was just what the Milesians had done. They sup-
posed that the world had not always existed in its present cosmic state.
They derived it from one substance, which they asserted to have changed
or moved in various ways-—becoming hotter or colder, drier or wetter,

tarer or denser-—in order to produce the present world-order.                              (Cf.
Parmenides, 8.40~1.) Of course if it had been said to them, ‘ What is,
is, is it not?’, they must have agreed at once. In refuting their conten-
tions, Parmenides is not so much proving the tautology as showing that
earlier thinkers, as well as the ordinary run of mankind, had never
formulated it explicitly, and so had evaded its implications. It is per-
haps che first, but certainly not the last time that a philosopher has
thought it necessary to start from a tautology for the same reasons.?
   In the long extract known as fr. 8, he starts by saying iz is’ (that is,
on the Dielsian interpretation, stating the tautology that what is, is),
and then goes on to state and demonstrate, not the statement that ‘it
is’, but certain ‘marks’ (ovuorra) along this way; that is, pertain attri-
butes which whatever is must possess. It must be evetlasting, in-
divisible, motionless, etc,, although hitherto people had carelessly said
that what is can come into being, divide itself, move, and perish. Even
here in fr. 2 it seems too much to say that ‘It is” is proved or argued
for. 1t is stated and said to be true. For the sake of completeness
Parmenides then mentions its contrary (though, as Owen and others
agree, there is no suggestion that anyone ever takes this way), and
briefly dismisses it as inconceivable. In this and fr. 8, taken together,
bhesays to his fellow-men in effect: “Whatis, is. You call this a tautology,
and so do 1, but you do not think clearly enough to see what that
admission leads to. If you give to & its full and proper force, you are
precluded from saying that what is suffers any process of becoming or
perishing, change or movement.’
   To repeat, this is no denial of the claim that what i, according to
Parmenides, is what can be spoken and thought of : he says so himself.
But the argument that no one thinks it necessary to argue fora tautology
does not rule out the possibility that if the subject were expressed in
2.3, it would run: *What is, is, and cannot not-be.” Moreover in the
same century Gorgias thought it possible 1o argue for a logical contra-
diction: he ‘proved’ that what is is not (008 & dv &oTw). If this
could be done, then surely at the same stage of thought, or slightly
  * “Trivialities and platitudes deserve emphatic affitmation when, as often in philosophy, they
are exphcitly or implicitly denied, or forgotten, or overlooked’ (J. R. Bambrough, Proc, drist.
Soe. 19601, 215).

 earlier, it could seem both possible and                         necessary to argue the
 tautology.’
    The significance of this will be brought out in fr. 8. Meanwhile he
 dismisses the statement * It is not” as impossible. For him it is sufficient
 justification of this to say that the subject of such a statement could
 never enter our minds, for what is not can neither be recognized nor
 pointed out to another. He could hardly have been expected to reckon
 with the frivolities of late fifth-century sophistry, The Sophists seized
 on the forms of Eleatic logic to make all knowledge seem absurd, as
 Gorgias was doing with his defence of the thesis ‘Itis not’. Parody-
 ing the title O Nature or the Existent commonly given to works of the
 natural philosophers, he produced a treatise On the Non-existent or
 on Nature, in which he argued three theses: () that nothing exists, (8)
 that if anything existed we could have no knowledge of it, (c) that if
 anyone knew it he could not communicate his knowledge.
    Fr, 3 is usually translated as above: ‘It is the same thing that can be
 thought and can be.” Similarly, 6. 1: “What can be spoken and thaught
 of must be (i.e. exist).”? To find any other English equivalent is difficult,
 but this only emphasizes the inadequacy of translation and the truth
 that language and thought are inseparable. As translated, the state-
 ments seem simply mistaken.                  [t is obviously possible to speak and
 think of objects that do not exist, like the unicorns, centaurs and present
 King of France beloved of the twentieth-century phifosopher.
    It is true that on this point philosophy has advanced, but for the
 historian the matter is not closed by saying that Parmenides was mis-
 taken. His ‘mistake’ opens the way to an understanding of the rather
 different conceptions of mental processes and speech held by the ancient
 Greeks.? The verb translated think of (noein) could not, in and before
 his time, convey the notion of imagining something non-existent, for
    ¢ Gorg, fr. 3; DK, 1, 280. t1ff. See also Reinhacde, Parm, 36.
     # For Mansfeld’s version see note on transiation. He denies the accepted view that fr. 3 follows
, direcily on fr. z and suggests (p. 82) a conjectural ine which, «f 1t stood between them, would
  yield the logic thar he favours.
    3 K. von Fritz has made the point that a smudy of the history of Greek philosophical and
 scientific terms offers a nnique opportunity far an inquiry into the connexions between philo-
 sophical and pre-phitosoplucal thought. This 15 because the Gresks developed their philosophical
 terminology entitely within their own language, not from foreign sources like ourselves. Their
 terms are therefore either words directly taken over from common speech or adaptarions of such
 words (CP, 1943, 79).

it connoted primarily an act of immediate recognition. In Homer it
may mean little more than seeing; at any rate it is directly connected
with the sense of vision, as in /L 15.422: ‘ When Hector saw with his
eyes (dvénoev dpfaduoiow) his cousin fallen in the dust.” More pre-
cisely, it is used when through the sight of a concrete object a character
suddenly realizes the full meaning of a situation. Aphrodite appeared
to Helen disguised as an old woman: only when Helen pierced the
disguise and recognized that she was dealing with a goddess is the verb
noein used (2L 3.396).          It may thus mean the substitutioq of a true for
a false impression, not considered as a process of reasonjing, but as a
sudden illumination, a seeing with the mind.! Similarly Y may mean
the visualization of things distant in time or space. (CL\Parm. 4.1.)
The faculty of doing this (noos ot nous) may be paralysed or put out of
action by physical force or strong emotion, but never in Homer, and
only very rarely in other surviving literature before Parmenides, can
it be deceived.?
    This peculiar status of the noos is emphasized by the belief in it as
something external to the other faculties, nat dependent like them on
bodily organs, and more than human.                     A character in the Helena of
Euripides says (1014f.): ‘ The nous of the dead is not indeed alive, yet
it has an immortal intelligence (or faculty of knowing, yucoun) when it
has plunged into the immortal aither.” More directly, in another line
of the same poet (fr. 1018): ' The rowus in each of us is god.” When
rational thought had progressed much further than in Parmenides’s
   * For further examples and analysis of véos and voslv in Homer, see von Fritz, CP, 1943,

use af the wotds ia Presocratic philasoply, in C2, 1945, 22343, and 1946, 12-34. (Cf. vol. 1,
426, . 1) His conclusion for Homer is that all the meanings found there “can be derived from
one original and fundamental concept, which may be defined as the realisation of a situation’.
The relationship 10 sight was well expressed by Sainte-Beuve in his Cahiers: *Homére dit noeo —

   * Von Fritz (CP, 1945, 226) finds three passages in Hesiod where the véos is not merely dulled
but deceived. They are Theog. 5375 E7ga, 323 and 373. But Theog. 537 is a reference to the
famous story of Prometheus and Zeus, Prometheus divided the portions Arbs véov tfecmagloxey,
“trying (or thinking) ca deceive the véas of Zeus’; whereas, as everyone knows, Zeus's véos was
not deceived. In Krga, 313, it is képBos that deceives the véos. This 15 very ¢lose in sense o the
passages in Homer where the v6os 15, in von F.’s words, dulled or blunted by emotion. The only
clear indication that deception can oceur is Erga, 373, which warns against allowing a lascivious
woman to decsive one’s véos. These three passages do however illustrate how * the rransition from
a dulled to a deceived véos is very easy’ (von F., CP, 1945, 226).

    time, Aristotle himself, for all his intellectual maturity and acute
    analysis of mental faculties and activities, felt bound to concede in-
    fallibility to nows, and to make a sharp distinction between its activity
    and the processes of discursive reasoning. In the Posterior Analytics
    he writes: *Of the thinking states by which we grasp truth, some are
    unfailingly true, others admit of error—opinion, for instance, and
    caleulation—whereas scientific knowing and nous are always true.” It
    even retains its mysterious and ambiguous status as ‘that which alone
    comes into us from outside and is divine’, and although Aristotle is
    contemptuous of religious doctrines of immortality and reincarnation,
    he admits that the psycke may perhaps survive the dissolution of the
    living man—-"not all of it, but the nous’.®                      Its proper function is to
    grasp universal truths immediately and intuitively, as in the inductive
    leap, and so to assure the primary premises or principles on which
    deductive argument is based.
       1t was, then, a general Greek belief that human powers of cognition
    included a faculty of immediate apprehension of the true nature of an
    object or situation, comparable to, but going deeper than, the im-
    mediate apprehension of superficial qualities by the senses.                           ‘In Greek
    philosophy itself. . .nous is never the merely siccum humen, the clear,
    cold light which we are sometimes in the habit of calling reason.’® Itis
 __this faculty thar Parmenides names when he says that whatever is
  » apprehended by it must be.
       There remains the impossibility of speaking about, or mentioning,
    what is not. This too was by no means an absurd contention for the

is phragein, which, though often translated ‘say” or “tell’, meant in the
epic language which Parmenides is using, and frequently later, to show
or point out. At6.1 he uses legein, the ordinary word for say, speak of,
or mean (Fr. vouloir dire). There are however indications that this word
t00 had a history (perhaps connected with the magical identification
of name and object) which made it difficult for a Greek to see how one
could logically speak of what was not. ‘To say nothing’ in Greek does
not mean to be silent: it is the regular expression for talking nonsense,
uttering what does not correspond with reality. The dii%‘mu]ty of the
problem here raised by Parmenides’s uncompromising and elementary
logic may be judged from the fact that Plato much later Had to devote
a considerable amount of attention to resolving it, in such 1anguage as:
It seems to follow necessarily that to speak of what is not ‘something’ is to
speak of nothing at all. Must we not even refuse to allow that in such a
case a person is saying something though he may be speaking of nothing?
Must we not assert that he is not even saying anything when he sets about
uttering the sounds ‘a thing that is not’*
   All previous thinkers had taken the physical world as a datum and
interested themselves in questions of its origin, the kind of basic stuff
that might underlie its variegated appearance, and the mechanical
processes by which it was produced. Parmenides refused to accept this
datum, or any datum. Like an ancient Descartes, he asked himself what,
if anything, it was impossible not to believe; and to him the answer was
est: something exists. U we accept Owen’s persuasive interpretation of
fr. 2, not even this was the ultimate premise. That was, like Descartes’s,
cogito; but the first inference was not cogito ergo sum, but cogito, ergo est
guad cogito.
                       (6) The true way and the false
(Fr. 6)     What can be spoken and thought of must be, for it is possible for
it to be, but impossible for nothing to be. This I bid thee consider, for this
way of inquiry is the first from which I ¢hold thee back).

tion represents what was for Parmenides a truth, as does that which takes 76 as a pronoun. (So

    6.1-2. 5. Tugwell (CQ, 1964, 36£.) claims that to give o its potential sense here and in 2.2
1s 10 sepacate that sense from the existental to a0 anachronustic extent. He therefore translates:
“What exists to be referred to or thought about must exist; for it 1s there to exist, nothing it not
there to exist.” The point is a difficult one. The potential use of ot goes back to Homer, so that
to translate it as potential here can hardly be called an anachronism. The argument against it
should surely be the novel      insistence of Parmenides    that elven always carries an existential
significance, Yet he caanot speak about the one Being at all without using ordinary language in
@ way which a strict application of his own criteria would disaflow. (Itis easy to pick our ex-
amples in fr. 8.) At the same time, since his conscious mnsistence on the existential force of elvan
is undoubted, Tugwell’s translation is suggestive and may represent something that was i his
mind. Bu if so, let no one continue to claim that Parmenides was incapable of arguing a tauto-
logy!

        These   two    quotations,        which      we    owe      to different       authorities,
 probably form one continuous passage of the poem. In the first three

apparently arguing that the object of speech and thought must exist
because prima facie it can exist; it cannot therefore be nothing, since
‘nothing’ cannot exist; but if it is something, it exists. Having then, in
the proof of the existence of the object of speech and thought, brought
in the statement that ‘nothing’ cannot exist, the goddess takes the
opportunity to point out that this way (which one must take ad sensum
to be the way of thinking that ‘nothing’ can exist) is the first to be
avoided. Itis the one mentioned in fr. 2 as the second of two conceiv-
able ways, and then dismissed as impossible to follow.
   Ostensibly, however, she goes on immediately to mention a third
way, which like the second is to be avoided. Now as Cor\pford pointed
aut (CQ, 1933, 99), it is not expressly stated in fr. 2 that the two ways
there mentioned exhaust the possibilities of ‘ways that alone can be
thought of’; and he concluded that the goddess meant to announce
three ways there, a fact which is only concealed by the fragmentary
nature of the text, Nevertheless, fr. 2 conveys a strong impression that
the two ways are exclusive of others, and pethaps we can allow that
Parmenides did speak of an initial duality without thereby doing
damage to the logical structure of the poem. The “third way’ is, afrer
all, not independent of the other two, but an illegitimate fusion of them
both. For Parmenides of all people there is no third possibility distinct
both from ‘it is” and ‘it is not”. The condemnation of morsals in fr. 6
rests on their belief that ‘1o be and not to be are the same and not the
same’. The statement rejected in fr. 7, ‘ that things that are not are’, is
only a rephrasing of this: it is ‘not the Way of Not-being, but the
mortal belief just mentioned, i.e. that what-is-not can be by becoming or
change’ (Cornford, Joc. cit. 100, . 3). The correctness of this is shown
by the following lines with their reference to eyes, ears and tongue;
and yet the belief that ‘it is possible for nothing to exist’ (the first false
way, warned against in ft. 6) could hardly be distinguished as an entirely
separate ‘way’ from one described by the words ‘that things that are
not are’,
   Nevertheless there are in fact three ways, one right and two wrong:
(1) belief that “It is’, i.e. something exists and the word is must be
applied to it with all its force; (2) denial that ‘It is’, or assertion that
there is nothing;    (3) haphazard confusion between ‘is” and *is not’.

                   Confusion between Being and Not-being
 Of the second way we hear no more, since none have been tempted to
 follow it. The third way incorporates the opinions of mortals, mentioned
 in the prologue as offering no true conviction. It is said to result from
 habit and the use of the senses, and includes the belief that *what is not
 is’ and that ‘to be and not to be are the same and not the same’.t
     It needs no argument that men believe that ‘to be and not to be are
 not the same’: 10 one in his senses would deny it. But, says Parmenides,
 they also think that ‘what is not is” and that ‘to be and not to be are
 the same’. When he goes on to deduce the consequences of the state-
 ment What is, is’, it becomes clear that in condemuing this behaviour
 he means to deny the belief in any change, motion, becoming or perish-
  ing of what is, a belief which results naturally from the use of eyes, ears
  and other sense-organs. Its logical refutation will come in fr. 8.
     1t is a much-disputed historical question whether this criticism is
  aimed partly or solely at Heraclitus. There is no external evidence to
  help: we can only say it is possible, but not certain, that Parmenides
  had read the other’s work. If he had, there is no doubt that it would
  have outsaged his logical mind. The view of Bernays that Heraclitus is
  the sole object of criticism was vigorously defended by Kranz, who
  went so far as to regard it as one of ‘the corerstones of the history of
  the Presocratics’.? In the same year Reinhardt was denying it outright,
  and von Fritz has declared that ‘Reinhardt has proved conclusively
  that Parmenides does not refer to Heraclitus in the famous passage on
  the error of the “two-headed mortals™’.
     We are hardly within the province of ‘conclusive proof’, but a few
  observations may be made. First, Parmenides’s language (or the
" language of the goddess) makes it clear that the stricture is directed

   Heraclitizing Hippocratic treatise De vicru, Since however he himself assumes a gap of only
   about ten years between the work of Heraclitus and Parmenides, purting Heraclitus’s after 490
   and Parmenides’s after 480, there was not much time for the *Hpaxhsiteror (first mentioned by
   Plato) or ot péaroves fpawherriznw (Ar. Meraph. 1010a11) to have got going, let alone hecome

against all and sundry, not confined to a particular philosopher. It can
only be a question of whether Heraclitus was in his mind as an out-
standing representative of the ‘hordes with no judgment’. The source
of their exror is reliance on eye and ear, and Heraclitus had said that he
gave preference 1o the objects of sight and hearing (fr. 55), which is
not contradicted by his assertion that eyes and ears are bad witnesses
if the psyche is barbarian (fr. 107). He saw truth in the ZLogos, and
Parmenides too uses this word in 7.5, perhaps, as Kranz thought, to
oppose a true logos to the other’s false one. Again, though “to be and
not to be are the same and nort the same’ can describe the!state of mind
of the ordinary man, its phraseology recalls nothing so‘,much as the
paradoxes in which Heraclitus and no one else showed such delight.r
Even if he did not say ‘ we are and are not” (fr. 49a, deemed spurious by
Gigon and Kirk), statements like ‘ wishes and does not wish’ (32), ‘by
differing it agrees’ (1), “in changing it rests’ (84a), ‘living and dead,
waking and asleep, young and old are the same’ (88) display the
quintessence of that imbecility which Parmenides here deplores. No
one but Heraclitus made such statements, and moreover the doctrine
of the identity of opposites in fr. 88 is made to depend on the fact of
change from one to the other; and change in Parmenides’s view implied
the being of what is not. Much more than the ordinary man, Heraclitus
made the whole world depend on a continuous process of change and
struggle.      He above all others was at the opposite               pole from      the
philosophy of motionless being, It is in the light of all this and more
that one must see the use of the word ‘backward-turning’ in 6.9,
which some have thought an unmistakable reference to the ‘back-
ward-turning adjustment” of Heraclitus fr. 53. (See vol. 1, 439, n. 3.)
To place such reliance on 2 single word is unwise, but also perhaps
unnecessary. Where no single phrase brings conviction, the cumulative
effect may be considerable.
   There are, then, strong hints in his language that for Parmenides
Heraclitus was the arch-offender, no doubt because, while other men
were inarticulately confused, he did not shrink from making                         the
contradiction explicit yec still upheld it. But the criticism applies to

all “ignorant mortals’, whether philosophers or not. Its point is that
what is, is, and cannot ever not be. To maintain this is to go against
al] common belief, according to which there is such a thing as genesis,
the process of coming into being. This process demands that the same
thing at one time is not and at another time is; also that it is at one time
the same and at another not the same. Thus men imagine things as
passing back and forth between being and notbeing, a course of thought
which ‘turns back upon itself’.
    Moreover in condemning this way the goddess warns Parmenides
against being forced along it by ‘habit born of experience’, which
again does not sound as if she had in mind solely the doctrine of one
 enigmatic and individual philosopher. What she is in fact enjoining on
him appears in the next lines: it is not to trust the senses,’ but instead to
Jjudge by reason. Here for the first time sense and reason are contrasted,
 and we are told that the senses deceive and that reason alone is to be
 trusted. It is a decisive moment in the history of European philosophy,
which can never be the same again. Whether or not Parmenides believed
the one reality to be material is a minor question which in any case
admits of no answer, but we cannot agree with Burnet (£GP, 182)
that ‘Parmenides is not, as some have said, the father of idealism; on
the contrary, all materialism depends on his view of reality’.
   Burnet refers to the fact that Parmenides, while still belonging to an
age before the word asomaton—incorporeal—had been invented,
relentlessly pursues monism to its ultimate logical conclusion, and so
infers his one reality to have been ‘a spherical, motionless, corporeal
plenum’, But let us think in Greek, remembering that even when a
later philosopher like Plato wished to refer to the two kinds of being
which we should naturally call corporeal and incorporeal, he did not
normally use the terms somatikon and asomaton: even when coined they
remained comparatively rare, He spoke of perceptible (aistheron) and
intelligible (noeton).      Atstheton can safely be identified with the bodily
wherever it occurs, and similarly noezon not only means ‘intelligible’
but also and everywhere denotes the bodiless and immaterial. The
essential point is therefore that Parmenides was the first to draw the
   ¥ Eye and ear at least. Itis probably true (see Mansfeld, Offendarung, 43) that the tongue is
introduced here as the organ of speech rather than taste,

distinction between aistheton and noeton—Dbetween the data of eyes and
ears on the one hand and of logos on the other—and to say that the latter
wasrealand trueand the former unreal. Material and non-material are con-
cepts which he would scarcely have understood : what matters is that in
his view reality cannot be seen or heard, felt or tasted, but only inferred
by a process of dialectical reasoning such as he was the first to employ.
Considering how much the distinction between intelligible and sensible
meant to Plato, and how he exalted the intelligible ar the expense of the
sensible, the conclusion can hardly be avoided that t}ie way to his
particufar form of idealism was first opened by Parmenides.                      It was not
without reason that he referred to him as ‘a reveren; and aweful
figure’,
                 (7) The only true way: the marks of ‘what is’
           (@) 1t is eternal, neither coming into being nor perishing
(Fr. 8, »v. 1-21) One way alone is yet left 1o tell of, namely that ‘It is’.
On this way are marks in plenty thar since it exists it is unborn and imperish~
able, whole, unique, immovable and without end.                (5) It was not in the past,
nor yet skall it be, since it now is, all together, one and contnuous.
   (6) For what birth of it wilt thou seek? How and from what did it grow ?
1 shall not allow thee to say or think ‘from what is not’, for it is not to be
said or thought that ‘it is not’. (9) And what need would have prompted it
to grow later or sooner, beginning from nothing? Thus it must either fully
be or else not be.
    (12) Nor will the force of evidence suffer anything besides itself to arise
from what is not. Therefore Justice does not relax with her fetters and allow
it to come into being or perish, but holds it fast. (16) The verdict on this
lies here: It is or it is not. But this verdict has already been given, as it had
10 be, that the one path should be left alone as unthinkable, unnamed, for it
is no true path, and that the other exists and is real. (19) How could what is
afterwards perish? And how could it come into being? (20) For if it came
into being, it is not, nor yet if it is going to be at some future time. Thus
becoming is extinguished, and perishing not to be heard of.

The translation of fr. 3 follows Zeller and Burnet. The infinitive has its original dative force,
<p>and the meaning is hterally <em>the same thing is for thinking and for being’, an exactly parallet
construction to elov vofioa 10 2.2. This justifies also the rendenng of        6.1 as It s necessary that
what 15 for speaking and thinking should be’, i.e. “What can be spoken and thought about must
be’. See Burnet, EGP, 173, n. 2. [ still think this the most probable translation, even if Burnet's
specific argument that the bare infinitive could not be the subject of a sentence is not conclusive.
(On that point see Heidel, Proc. Am. Ae. 1913, 720, and Verdenius, Parm. 34£)                   It does not
(like Holscher’s version criticized by Mansfeld, Offentarung, 63) involve the incongruity of taking
voev as passive and elvea as active (if it is right 1o speak in these terms when elves is not a transitive
verb), Mansfeld’s preferred Ganslation (</em> Denn Denken und Sein sind dasselbe”) turns our 1o
mean much the same. It does not, he says, imply (as ane would suppase) che idenuty of Thought
and Being, but only that ‘the object of thought is at the same time the subject of being” (op. cit.
67); or as he puts it an p. tor, with what seems ro me doubrful logic: * Das Seiende ist der einzige
Gegenstand des Denkens, das einzig Denkbare. Deshalb sind Sein und Denken identisch.’ (My
italies.)</p>
  The subject of the verb ‘is’ is not expressly named.                                  It has most
<p>commonly been taken to be ‘what is’, i.e. Parmerudes is uttering a
logical tautology: what is, is. So for instance Diels and Cornford.
Burnet construed it as body or corporeality: ‘ The assertion that ir is
amounts just to this, that the universe is a plenum.” This conclusion is,
as Raven justly remarks, ‘at least premature’, Verdenius suggested ‘all
that exists, the total of things’, again perhaps prematurely.” Others
have thought it wrong to look for any subject. ‘At this early stage in
his poem Parmenides’s premise £om (it is) has no definite subject at
all’ So Raven and Frinkel suggested that the verb s ‘is primarily
used by Parmenides as a so-called impersonal, somewhat like “it

rains”, “raining takes place”’. To this Professor Owen has pertin-
ently objected that something more definite must be intended ‘becanse
Parmenides goes on to prove various characteristics of the subject of
his #o1’.     Owen’s own solution is that ‘what is declared to exist is
simply what can be talked or thought about’, and is actually mentioned,
not here in fr. 2, but in fr. 6.1: “What can be spoken and thought about
must be.”
Thus the serious choice of subject lies between ‘what is’ and ‘what
<p>can be talked and thought about’.               In one way it does nat seem serious,
for Parmenides in any case identifies the two, and according to Owen
himself, ‘no one will deny that, as the argument goes, 7 2év [what is)
is a correct description of the subject’, His objection to taking it as the
unexpressed subject itself is the logical one that ‘it turns the is into a
mere tautology, and the is not correspondingly into a flat contradiction,
whereas Parmenides thinks it necessary to argue for is and against is
not’. He does not assume it from the start.
In saying that something is, Parmenides undoubtedly had in mind
<p>what can be ralked and thought about, since he explicitly identifies the
two. That then is a correct description of the subject, as also is “what
is’. Nevertheless it does not seem quite fair to scholars such as Corn-
ford, who suppose that in fr. 2 he is saying simply ‘what is, is’, to
object either that they are unaware that a tantology is incapable of
proof, or that they accuse Parmenides of failing to see this simple point.
The history of Greek thought up to his time may allow a different
<p>view, for the polemical character of the poem is unquestioned. Later
he argues with devastating precision that once one has said that some-
thing is, one is debarred from saying that it was or will de, of attributing
to it an origin or a dissolution in time, or any alteration or motjon
whatsoever. But this was just what the Milesians had done. They sup-
posed that the world had not always existed in its present cosmic state.
They derived it from one substance, which they asserted to have changed
or moved in various ways-—becoming hotter or colder, drier or wetter,

tarer or denser-—in order to produce the present world-order.                              (Cf.
Parmenides, 8.40~1.) Of course if it had been said to them, ‘ What is,
is, is it not?’, they must have agreed at once. In refuting their conten-
tions, Parmenides is not so much proving the tautology as showing that
earlier thinkers, as well as the ordinary run of mankind, had never
formulated it explicitly, and so had evaded its implications. It is per-
haps che first, but certainly not the last time that a philosopher has
thought it necessary to start from a tautology for the same reasons.?
In the long extract known as fr. 8, he starts by saying iz is’ (that is,
<p>on the Dielsian interpretation, stating the tautology that what is, is),
and then goes on to state and demonstrate, not the statement that ‘it
is’, but certain ‘marks’ (ovuorra) along this way; that is, pertain attri-
butes which whatever is must possess. It must be evetlasting, in-
divisible, motionless, etc,, although hitherto people had carelessly said
that what is can come into being, divide itself, move, and perish. Even
here in fr. 2 it seems too much to say that ‘It is” is proved or argued
for. 1t is stated and said to be true. For the sake of completeness
Parmenides then mentions its contrary (though, as Owen and others
agree, there is no suggestion that anyone ever takes this way), and
briefly dismisses it as inconceivable. In this and fr. 8, taken together,
bhesays to his fellow-men in effect: “Whatis, is. You call this a tautology,
and so do 1, but you do not think clearly enough to see what that
admission leads to. If you give to &amp; its full and proper force, you are
precluded from saying that what is suffers any process of becoming or
perishing, change or movement.’
To repeat, this is no denial of the claim that what i, according to
<p>Parmenides, is what can be spoken and thought of : he says so himself.
But the argument that no one thinks it necessary to argue fora tautology
does not rule out the possibility that if the subject were expressed in
2.3, it would run: <em>What is, is, and cannot not-be.” Moreover in the
same century Gorgias thought it possible 1o argue for a logical contra-
diction: he ‘proved’ that what is is not (008 &amp; dv &amp;oTw). If this
could be done, then surely at the same stage of thought, or slightly

 earlier, it could seem both possible and                         necessary to argue the
 tautology.’
 The significance of this will be brought out in fr. 8. Meanwhile he
<p> dismisses the statement <em> It is not” as impossible. For him it is sufficient
 justification of this to say that the subject of such a statement could
 never enter our minds, for what is not can neither be recognized nor
 pointed out to another. He could hardly have been expected to reckon
 with the frivolities of late fifth-century sophistry, The Sophists seized
 on the forms of Eleatic logic to make all knowledge seem absurd, as
 Gorgias was doing with his defence of the thesis ‘Itis not’. Parody-
 ing the title O Nature or the Existent commonly given to works of the
 natural philosophers, he produced a treatise On the Non-existent or
 on Nature, in which he argued three theses: () that nothing exists, (8)
 that if anything existed we could have no knowledge of it, (c) that if
 anyone knew it he could not communicate his knowledge.
 Fr, 3 is usually translated as above: ‘It is the same thing that can be
<p> thought and can be.” Similarly, 6. 1: “What can be spoken and thaught
 of must be (i.e. exist).”? To find any other English equivalent is difficult,
 but this only emphasizes the inadequacy of translation and the truth
 that language and thought are inseparable. As translated, the state-
 ments seem simply mistaken.                  [t is obviously possible to speak and
 think of objects that do not exist, like the unicorns, centaurs and present
 King of France beloved of the twentieth-century phifosopher.
 It is true that on this point philosophy has advanced, but for the
<p> historian the matter is not closed by saying that Parmenides was mis-
 taken. His ‘mistake’ opens the way to an understanding of the rather
 different conceptions of mental processes and speech held by the ancient
 Greeks.? The verb translated think of (noein) could not, in and before
 his time, convey the notion of imagining something non-existent, for

 3 K. von Fritz has made the point that a smudy of the history of Greek philosophical and
<p> scientific terms offers a nnique opportunity far an inquiry into the connexions between philo-
 sophical and pre-phitosoplucal thought. This 15 because the Gresks developed their philosophical
 terminology entitely within their own language, not from foreign sources like ourselves. Their
 terms are therefore either words directly taken over from common speech or adaptarions of such
 words (CP, 1943, 79).

it connoted primarily an act of immediate recognition. In Homer it
may mean little more than seeing; at any rate it is directly connected
with the sense of vision, as in /L 15.422: ‘ When Hector saw with his
eyes (dvénoev dpfaduoiow) his cousin fallen in the dust.” More pre-
cisely, it is used when through the sight of a concrete object a character
suddenly realizes the full meaning of a situation. Aphrodite appeared
to Helen disguised as an old woman: only when Helen pierced the
disguise and recognized that she was dealing with a goddess is the verb
noein used (2L 3.396).          It may thus mean the substitutioq of a true for
a false impression, not considered as a process of reasonjing, but as a
sudden illumination, a seeing with the mind.! Similarly Y may mean
the visualization of things distant in time or space. (CL\Parm. 4.1.)
The faculty of doing this (noos ot nous) may be paralysed or put out of
action by physical force or strong emotion, but never in Homer, and
only very rarely in other surviving literature before Parmenides, can
it be deceived.?
 This peculiar status of the noos is emphasized by the belief in it as
<p>something external to the other faculties, nat dependent like them on
bodily organs, and more than human.                     A character in the Helena of
Euripides says (1014f.): ‘ The nous of the dead is not indeed alive, yet
it has an immortal intelligence (or faculty of knowing, yucoun) when it
has plunged into the immortal aither.” More directly, in another line
of the same poet (fr. 1018): ' The rowus in each of us is god.” When
rational thought had progressed much further than in Parmenides’s

</em> For further examples and analysis of véos and voslv in Homer, see von Fritz, CP, 1943,
79~83. What is said here owes much to his excellent article and those which followed it on the
use af the wotds ia Presocratic philasoply, in C2, 1945, 22343, and 1946, 12-34. (Cf. vol. 1,
426, . 1) His conclusion for Homer is that all the meanings found there “can be derived from
one original and fundamental concept, which may be defined as the realisation of a situation’.
The relationship 10 sight was well expressed by Sainte-Beuve in his Cahiers: <em>Homére dit noeo —
je vors, je conpms. Vour &amp;1 concevoar, c'esy Ja méme chose, ce n’est pus la sensanon, c'est 38 Ja
peasée, la perceprion,’

</em> Von Fritz (CP, 1945, 226) finds three passages in Hesiod where the véos is not merely dulled
but deceived. They are Theog. 5375 E7ga, 323 and 373. But Theog. 537 is a reference to the
famous story of Prometheus and Zeus, Prometheus divided the portions Arbs véov tfecmagloxey,
“trying (or thinking) ca deceive the véas of Zeus’; whereas, as everyone knows, Zeus's véos was
not deceived. In Krga, 313, it is képBos that deceives the véos. This 15 very ¢lose in sense o the
passages in Homer where the v6os 15, in von F.’s words, dulled or blunted by emotion. The only
clear indication that deception can oceur is Erga, 373, which warns against allowing a lascivious
woman to decsive one’s véos. These three passages do however illustrate how * the rransition from
a dulled to a deceived véos is very easy’ (von F., CP, 1945, 226).</p>

 time, Aristotle himself, for all his intellectual maturity and acute
 analysis of mental faculties and activities, felt bound to concede in-
 fallibility to nows, and to make a sharp distinction between its activity
 and the processes of discursive reasoning. In the Posterior Analytics
 he writes: *Of the thinking states by which we grasp truth, some are
 unfailingly true, others admit of error—opinion, for instance, and
 caleulation—whereas scientific knowing and nous are always true.” It
 even retains its mysterious and ambiguous status as ‘that which alone
 comes into us from outside and is divine’, and although Aristotle is
 contemptuous of religious doctrines of immortality and reincarnation,
 he admits that the psycke may perhaps survive the dissolution of the
 living man—-&quot;not all of it, but the nous’.®                      Its proper function is to
 grasp universal truths immediately and intuitively, as in the inductive
 leap, and so to assure the primary premises or principles on which
 deductive argument is based.
    1t was, then, a general Greek belief that human powers of cognition
 included a faculty of immediate apprehension of the true nature of an
 object or situation, comparable to, but going deeper than, the im-
 mediate apprehension of superficial qualities by the senses.                           ‘In Greek
 philosophy itself. . .nous is never the merely siccum humen, the clear,
 cold light which we are sometimes in the habit of calling reason.’® Itis
<p> <em></em>this faculty thar Parmenides names when he says that whatever is
  » apprehended by it must be.
    There remains the impossibility of speaking about, or mentioning,
 what is not. This too was by no means an absurd contention for the

is phragein, which, though often translated ‘say” or “tell’, meant in the
epic language which Parmenides is using, and frequently later, to show
or point out. At6.1 he uses legein, the ordinary word for say, speak of,
or mean (Fr. vouloir dire). There are however indications that this word
t00 had a history (perhaps connected with the magical identification
of name and object) which made it difficult for a Greek to see how one
could logically speak of what was not. ‘To say nothing’ in Greek does
not mean to be silent: it is the regular expression for talking nonsense,
uttering what does not correspond with reality. The dii%‘mu]ty of the
problem here raised by Parmenides’s uncompromising and elementary
logic may be judged from the fact that Plato much later Had to devote
a considerable amount of attention to resolving it, in such 1anguage as:
It seems to follow necessarily that to speak of what is not ‘something’ is to
speak of nothing at all. Must we not even refuse to allow that in such a
case a person is saying something though he may be speaking of nothing?
Must we not assert that he is not even saying anything when he sets about
uttering the sounds ‘a thing that is not’<em>
All previous thinkers had taken the physical world as a datum and
<p>interested themselves in questions of its origin, the kind of basic stuff
that might underlie its variegated appearance, and the mechanical
processes by which it was produced. Parmenides refused to accept this
datum, or any datum. Like an ancient Descartes, he asked himself what,
if anything, it was impossible not to believe; and to him the answer was
est: something exists. U we accept Owen’s persuasive interpretation of
fr. 2, not even this was the ultimate premise. That was, like Descartes’s,
cogito; but the first inference was not cogito ergo sum, but cogito, ergo est
guad cogito.

But also from this one, on which mortals, knowing nothing, wander two-
<p>headed ; for helplessness in their owa breasts guides their ecring mind. They
are borne along, both deaf and blind, mazed, hordes with no judgment, who
believe that to be and not to be are the same and not the same, and the path
of everything is one that turns back upon jtself.
(Fr.7) For this shall never prevail, that things that are not are, but do
<p>thou keep thy thought from this way of inquiry; and let not habit born of
much experience force thee along this way, to ply a heedless eye and sound-
ing ear and a tongue, but judge by reason (logos) the much-contested
refutation spoken by me.
6.1, The construction is the same as in fr. 2.1 and fr. 3. So Burnet, EGP, 174, n. 1, who points
<p>out that Simplicius supports the rendering, Kranz(SB Preuss. Ak, 1936,1373,an8 in DK) rranslates
differantly; 'It is necessary to say and to think that onfy what is {das Seiende] is.” Either transla-
tion represents what was for Parmenides a truth, as does that which takes 76 as a pronoun. (So
Mausfeld, Qffenbarung, 81: <em>‘Man muss folgendes sagen und denken: nur das Siende ist.’ Iralics
are his)
 6.1-2. 5. Tugwell (CQ, 1964, 36£.) claims that to give o its potential sense here and in 2.2
<p>1s 10 sepacate that sense from the existental to a0 anachronustic extent. He therefore translates:
“What exists to be referred to or thought about must exist; for it 1s there to exist, nothing it not
there to exist.” The point is a difficult one. The potential use of ot goes back to Homer, so that
to translate it as potential here can hardly be called an anachronism. The argument against it
should surely be the novel      insistence of Parmenides    that elven always carries an existential
significance, Yet he caanot speak about the one Being at all without using ordinary language in
@ way which a strict application of his own criteria would disaflow. (Itis easy to pick our ex-
amples in fr. 8.) At the same time, since his conscious mnsistence on the existential force of elvan
is undoubted, Tugwell’s translation is suggestive and may represent something that was i his
mind. Bu if so, let no one continue to claim that Parmenides was incapable of arguing a tauto-
logy!

        These   two    quotations,        which      we    owe      to different       authorities,
 probably form one continuous passage of the poem. In the first three
 lines the thought is uncomfortably condensed, but Parmenides is

apparently arguing that the object of speech and thought must exist
because prima facie it can exist; it cannot therefore be nothing, since
‘nothing’ cannot exist; but if it is something, it exists. Having then, in
the proof of the existence of the object of speech and thought, brought
in the statement that ‘nothing’ cannot exist, the goddess takes the
opportunity to point out that this way (which one must take ad sensum
to be the way of thinking that ‘nothing’ can exist) is the first to be
avoided. Itis the one mentioned in fr. 2 as the second of two conceiv-
able ways, and then dismissed as impossible to follow.
   Ostensibly, however, she goes on immediately to mention a third
way, which like the second is to be avoided. Now as Cor\pford pointed
aut (CQ, 1933, 99), it is not expressly stated in fr. 2 that the two ways
there mentioned exhaust the possibilities of ‘ways that alone can be
thought of’; and he concluded that the goddess meant to announce
three ways there, a fact which is only concealed by the fragmentary
nature of the text, Nevertheless, fr. 2 conveys a strong impression that
the two ways are exclusive of others, and pethaps we can allow that
Parmenides did speak of an initial duality without thereby doing
damage to the logical structure of the poem. The “third way’ is, afrer
all, not independent of the other two, but an illegitimate fusion of them
both. For Parmenides of all people there is no third possibility distinct
both from ‘it is” and ‘it is not”. The condemnation of morsals in fr. 6
rests on their belief that ‘1o be and not to be are the same and not the
same’. The statement rejected in fr. 7, ‘ that things that are not are’, is
only a rephrasing of this: it is ‘not the Way of Not-being, but the
mortal belief just mentioned, i.e. that what-is-not can be by becoming or
change’ (Cornford, Joc. cit. 100, . 3). The correctness of this is shown
by the following lines with their reference to eyes, ears and tongue;
and yet the belief that ‘it is possible for nothing to exist’ (the first false
way, warned against in ft. 6) could hardly be distinguished as an entirely
separate ‘way’ from one described by the words ‘that things that are
not are’,
   Nevertheless there are in fact three ways, one right and two wrong:
(1) belief that “It is’, i.e. something exists and the word is must be
applied to it with all its force; (2) denial that ‘It is’, or assertion that
there is nothing;    (3) haphazard confusion between ‘is” and *is not’.

                   Confusion between Being and Not-being
 Of the second way we hear no more, since none have been tempted to
 follow it. The third way incorporates the opinions of mortals, mentioned
 in the prologue as offering no true conviction. It is said to result from
 habit and the use of the senses, and includes the belief that *what is not
 is’ and that ‘to be and not to be are the same and not the same’.t
     It needs no argument that men believe that ‘to be and not to be are
 not the same’: 10 one in his senses would deny it. But, says Parmenides,
 they also think that ‘what is not is” and that ‘to be and not to be are
 the same’. When he goes on to deduce the consequences of the state-
 ment What is, is’, it becomes clear that in condemuing this behaviour
 he means to deny the belief in any change, motion, becoming or perish-
  ing of what is, a belief which results naturally from the use of eyes, ears
  and other sense-organs. Its logical refutation will come in fr. 8.
     1t is a much-disputed historical question whether this criticism is
  aimed partly or solely at Heraclitus. There is no external evidence to
  help: we can only say it is possible, but not certain, that Parmenides
  had read the other’s work. If he had, there is no doubt that it would
  have outsaged his logical mind. The view of Bernays that Heraclitus is
  the sole object of criticism was vigorously defended by Kranz, who
  went so far as to regard it as one of ‘the corerstones of the history of
  the Presocratics’.? In the same year Reinhardt was denying it outright,
  and von Fritz has declared that ‘Reinhardt has proved conclusively
  that Parmenides does not refer to Heraclitus in the famous passage on
  the error of the “two-headed mortals™’.
     We are hardly within the province of ‘conclusive proof’, but a few
  observations may be made. First, Parmenides’s language (or the
" language of the goddess) makes it clear that the stricture is directed
     * Mansfeld (Offenbarung, 31 and 34) apparently thinks 1t 15 the belief of mortals in cheir own
  existence that is in quesiion. He does not argue the point, and it 15 surely very unhkely,

   Heraclitizing Hippocratic treatise De vicru, Since however he himself assumes a gap of only
   about ten years between the work of Heraclitus and Parmenides, purting Heraclitus’s after 490
   and Parmenides’s after 480, there was not much time for the *Hpaxhsiteror (first mentioned by
   Plato) or ot péaroves fpawherriznw (Ar. Meraph. 1010a11) to have got going, let alone hecome

against all and sundry, not confined to a particular philosopher. It can
only be a question of whether Heraclitus was in his mind as an out-
standing representative of the ‘hordes with no judgment’. The source
of their exror is reliance on eye and ear, and Heraclitus had said that he
gave preference 1o the objects of sight and hearing (fr. 55), which is
not contradicted by his assertion that eyes and ears are bad witnesses
if the psyche is barbarian (fr. 107). He saw truth in the ZLogos, and
Parmenides too uses this word in 7.5, perhaps, as Kranz thought, to
oppose a true logos to the other’s false one. Again, though “to be and
not to be are the same and nort the same’ can describe the!state of mind
of the ordinary man, its phraseology recalls nothing so‘,much as the
paradoxes in which Heraclitus and no one else showed such delight.r
Even if he did not say ‘ we are and are not” (fr. 49a, deemed spurious by
Gigon and Kirk), statements like ‘ wishes and does not wish’ (32), ‘by
differing it agrees’ (1), “in changing it rests’ (84a), ‘living and dead,
waking and asleep, young and old are the same’ (88) display the
quintessence of that imbecility which Parmenides here deplores. No
one but Heraclitus made such statements, and moreover the doctrine
of the identity of opposites in fr. 88 is made to depend on the fact of
change from one to the other; and change in Parmenides’s view implied
the being of what is not. Much more than the ordinary man, Heraclitus
made the whole world depend on a continuous process of change and
struggle.      He above all others was at the opposite               pole from      the
philosophy of motionless being, It is in the light of all this and more
that one must see the use of the word ‘backward-turning’ in 6.9,
which some have thought an unmistakable reference to the ‘back-
ward-turning adjustment” of Heraclitus fr. 53. (See vol. 1, 439, n. 3.)
To place such reliance on 2 single word is unwise, but also perhaps
unnecessary. Where no single phrase brings conviction, the cumulative
effect may be considerable.
   There are, then, strong hints in his language that for Parmenides
Heraclitus was the arch-offender, no doubt because, while other men
were inarticulately confused, he did not shrink from making                         the
contradiction explicit yec still upheld it. But the criticism applies to

thing at one time is not and at another time is; also that it is at one time
the same and at another not the same. Thus men imagine things as
passing back and forth between being and notbeing, a course of thought
which ‘turns back upon itself’.
    Moreover in condemning this way the goddess warns Parmenides
against being forced along it by ‘habit born of experience’, which
again does not sound as if she had in mind solely the doctrine of one
 enigmatic and individual philosopher. What she is in fact enjoining on
him appears in the next lines: it is not to trust the senses,’ but instead to
Jjudge by reason. Here for the first time sense and reason are contrasted,
 and we are told that the senses deceive and that reason alone is to be
 trusted. It is a decisive moment in the history of European philosophy,
which can never be the same again. Whether or not Parmenides believed
the one reality to be material is a minor question which in any case
admits of no answer, but we cannot agree with Burnet (£GP, 182)
that ‘Parmenides is not, as some have said, the father of idealism; on
the contrary, all materialism depends on his view of reality’.
   Burnet refers to the fact that Parmenides, while still belonging to an
age before the word asomaton—incorporeal—had been invented,
relentlessly pursues monism to its ultimate logical conclusion, and so
infers his one reality to have been ‘a spherical, motionless, corporeal
plenum’, But let us think in Greek, remembering that even when a
later philosopher like Plato wished to refer to the two kinds of being
which we should naturally call corporeal and incorporeal, he did not
normally use the terms somatikon and asomaton: even when coined they
remained comparatively rare, He spoke of perceptible (aistheron) and
intelligible (noeton).      Atstheton can safely be identified with the bodily
wherever it occurs, and similarly noezon not only means ‘intelligible’
but also and everywhere denotes the bodiless and immaterial. The
essential point is therefore that Parmenides was the first to draw the
   ¥ Eye and ear at least. Itis probably true (see Mansfeld, Offendarung, 43) that the tongue is
introduced here as the organ of speech rather than taste,

distinction between aistheton and noeton—Dbetween the data of eyes and
ears on the one hand and of logos on the other—and to say that the latter
wasrealand trueand the former unreal. Material and non-material are con-
cepts which he would scarcely have understood : what matters is that in
his view reality cannot be seen or heard, felt or tasted, but only inferred
by a process of dialectical reasoning such as he was the first to employ.
Considering how much the distinction between intelligible and sensible
meant to Plato, and how he exalted the intelligible ar the expense of the
sensible, the conclusion can hardly be avoided that t}ie way to his
particufar form of idealism was first opened by Parmenides.                      It was not
without reason that he referred to him as ‘a reveren; and aweful
figure’,
                 (7) The only true way: the marks of ‘what is’
           (@) 1t is eternal, neither coming into being nor perishing
(Fr. 8, »v. 1-21) One way alone is yet left 1o tell of, namely that ‘It is’.
On this way are marks in plenty thar since it exists it is unborn and imperish~
able, whole, unique, immovable and without end.                (5) It was not in the past,
nor yet skall it be, since it now is, all together, one and contnuous.
   (6) For what birth of it wilt thou seek? How and from what did it grow ?
1 shall not allow thee to say or think ‘from what is not’, for it is not to be
said or thought that ‘it is not’. (9) And what need would have prompted it
to grow later or sooner, beginning from nothing? Thus it must either fully
be or else not be.
    (12) Nor will the force of evidence suffer anything besides itself to arise
from what is not. Therefore Justice does not relax with her fetters and allow
it to come into being or perish, but holds it fast. (16) The verdict on this
lies here: It is or it is not. But this verdict has already been given, as it had
10 be, that the one path should be left alone as unthinkable, unnamed, for it
is no true path, and that the other exists and is real. (19) How could what is
afterwards perish? And how could it come into being? (20) For if it came
into being, it is not, nor yet if it is going to be at some future time. Thus
becoming is extinguished, and perishing not to be heard of.

     These   two    quotations,        which      we    owe      to different       authorities,
<p> probably form one continuous passage of the poem. In the first three
 lines the thought is uncomfortably condensed, but Parmenides is

apparently arguing that the object of speech and thought must exist
because prima facie it can exist; it cannot therefore be nothing, since
‘nothing’ cannot exist; but if it is something, it exists. Having then, in
the proof of the existence of the object of speech and thought, brought
in the statement that ‘nothing’ cannot exist, the goddess takes the
opportunity to point out that this way (which one must take ad sensum
to be the way of thinking that ‘nothing’ can exist) is the first to be
avoided. Itis the one mentioned in fr. 2 as the second of two conceiv-
able ways, and then dismissed as impossible to follow.
Ostensibly, however, she goes on immediately to mention a third
<p>way, which like the second is to be avoided. Now as Cor\pford pointed
aut (CQ, 1933, 99), it is not expressly stated in fr. 2 that the two ways
there mentioned exhaust the possibilities of ‘ways that alone can be
thought of’; and he concluded that the goddess meant to announce
three ways there, a fact which is only concealed by the fragmentary
nature of the text, Nevertheless, fr. 2 conveys a strong impression that
the two ways are exclusive of others, and pethaps we can allow that
Parmenides did speak of an initial duality without thereby doing
damage to the logical structure of the poem. The “third way’ is, afrer
all, not independent of the other two, but an illegitimate fusion of them
both. For Parmenides of all people there is no third possibility distinct
both from ‘it is” and ‘it is not”. The condemnation of morsals in fr. 6
rests on their belief that ‘1o be and not to be are the same and not the
same’. The statement rejected in fr. 7, ‘ that things that are not are’, is
only a rephrasing of this: it is ‘not the Way of Not-being, but the
mortal belief just mentioned, i.e. that what-is-not can be by becoming or
change’ (Cornford, Joc. cit. 100, . 3). The correctness of this is shown
by the following lines with their reference to eyes, ears and tongue;
and yet the belief that ‘it is possible for nothing to exist’ (the first false
way, warned against in ft. 6) could hardly be distinguished as an entirely
separate ‘way’ from one described by the words ‘that things that are
not are’,
Nevertheless there are in fact three ways, one right and two wrong:
<p>(1) belief that “It is’, i.e. something exists and the word is must be
applied to it with all its force; (2) denial that ‘It is’, or assertion that
there is nothing;    (3) haphazard confusion between ‘is” and <em>is not’.

<p>                   Confusion between Being and Not-being
 Of the second way we hear no more, since none have been tempted to
 follow it. The third way incorporates the opinions of mortals, mentioned
 in the prologue as offering no true conviction. It is said to result from
 habit and the use of the senses, and includes the belief that </p>
</em>what is not
 is’ and that ‘to be and not to be are the same and not the same’.t
  It needs no argument that men believe that ‘to be and not to be are
<p> not the same’: 10 one in his senses would deny it. But, says Parmenides,
 they also think that ‘what is not is” and that ‘to be and not to be are
 the same’. When he goes on to deduce the consequences of the state-
 ment What is, is’, it becomes clear that in condemuing this behaviour
 he means to deny the belief in any change, motion, becoming or perish-
  ing of what is, a belief which results naturally from the use of eyes, ears
  and other sense-organs. Its logical refutation will come in fr. 8.
  1t is a much-disputed historical question whether this criticism is
<p>  aimed partly or solely at Heraclitus. There is no external evidence to
  help: we can only say it is possible, but not certain, that Parmenides
  had read the other’s work. If he had, there is no doubt that it would
  have outsaged his logical mind. The view of Bernays that Heraclitus is
  the sole object of criticism was vigorously defended by Kranz, who
  went so far as to regard it as one of ‘the corerstones of the history of
  the Presocratics’.? In the same year Reinhardt was denying it outright,
  and von Fritz has declared that ‘Reinhardt has proved conclusively
  that Parmenides does not refer to Heraclitus in the famous passage on
  the error of the “two-headed mortals™’.
  We are hardly within the province of ‘conclusive proof’, but a few
<p>  observations may be made. First, Parmenides’s language (or the
" language of the goddess) makes it clear that the stricture is directed

Heraclitizing Hippocratic treatise De vicru, Since however he himself assumes a gap of only
about ten years between the work of Heraclitus and Parmenides, purting Heraclitus’s after 490
and Parmenides’s after 480, there was not much time for the

against all and sundry, not confined to a particular philosopher. It can
only be a question of whether Heraclitus was in his mind as an out-
standing representative of the ‘hordes with no judgment’. The source
of their exror is reliance on eye and ear, and Heraclitus had said that he
gave preference 1o the objects of sight and hearing (fr. 55), which is
not contradicted by his assertion that eyes and ears are bad witnesses
if the psyche is barbarian (fr. 107). He saw truth in the ZLogos, and
Parmenides too uses this word in 7.5, perhaps, as Kranz thought, to
oppose a true logos to the other’s false one. Again, though “to be and
not to be are the same and nort the same’ can describe the!state of mind
of the ordinary man, its phraseology recalls nothing so‘,much as the
paradoxes in which Heraclitus and no one else showed such delight.r
Even if he did not say ‘ we are and are not” (fr. 49a, deemed spurious by
Gigon and Kirk), statements like ‘ wishes and does not wish’ (32), ‘by
differing it agrees’ (1), “in changing it rests’ (84a), ‘living and dead,
waking and asleep, young and old are the same’ (88) display the
quintessence of that imbecility which Parmenides here deplores. No
one but Heraclitus made such statements, and moreover the doctrine
of the identity of opposites in fr. 88 is made to depend on the fact of
change from one to the other; and change in Parmenides’s view implied
the being of what is not. Much more than the ordinary man, Heraclitus
made the whole world depend on a continuous process of change and
struggle.      He above all others was at the opposite               pole from      the
philosophy of motionless being, It is in the light of all this and more
that one must see the use of the word ‘backward-turning’ in 6.9,
which some have thought an unmistakable reference to the ‘back-
ward-turning adjustment” of Heraclitus fr. 53. (See vol. 1, 439, n. 3.)
To place such reliance on 2 single word is unwise, but also perhaps
unnecessary. Where no single phrase brings conviction, the cumulative
effect may be considerable.
There are, then, strong hints in his language that for Parmenides
<p>Heraclitus was the arch-offender, no doubt because, while other men
were inarticulately confused, he did not shrink from making                         the
contradiction explicit yec still upheld it. But the criticism applies to

 stated in other words in vv. 36—7: ‘Nothing else either is or will be hesides that whichis.' On
 thisinterpretation, what Parmenides 1s giving here is an argument for theuniqueness and wholeness
 of the one being, and my main reason for not adopung it is that this seems an intrusion into the
 arguments against its birth and destruction which otherwise fill the whole of this section. Its
 wholeness (continuity, indivisibility) is argued in v», 22-5, and enails its uniqueness, which

We now embark on the central theme of Parmenides’s doctrine, the
<p>deductions to be drawn from the simple statement eszi: ‘It is” or
" “Something exists’. The word had been used hitherto to cover much
the same variety of meaning as the English verb ‘to be’, It meant what
we more usually express by the word ‘exist’, though one may compare
 the biblical ‘Before Abraham was, I am’, and the noun ‘a being” mean-
 ing an existing thing or creature, It also expressed, like its English
 counterpart, predication or relationship—'is white’, ‘is greater than’
 —~though it should be noted that in non-existential sentences the copula
 was frequently omitted: in Greek ‘Socrates wise’ (6 Zeokpdns copis)
 is a complete sentence. No grammatical or semantic work had yet been

done to distinguish between different senses of the same word, and
there was still a general tendency, which we have remarked before
(vol. 1, 85, 86), to assume that a single word had only one ‘proper’
meaning, This proper meaning Parmenides assumes to be the existen-
tial, and on that assumption draws certain conclusions which under-
mine the universally accepted conception of the real world. The
necessary characteristics of reality are briefly listed in vv. 3—6 of fr. 8:
it is eternal, unmoving, one and continuous, and past and future are
meaningless for it. In the following lines these fe}mres are sub-
stantiated one by one.                                                  '
 The main weight of the passage so far translatedx is directed at
proving that ‘what i’ cannot have come into existencé at some past
time, nor can it cease 1o be in the future. It must be admitted that the
argument against becoming would appear better balanced if one had
the boldness to excise, as Reinhardt insisted on doing, the negative
from v. 12, This would give a symmetrical refutation of the coming-to-
be of what is, namely that it could not have come to be either from
what is not (7-9) or from what is (x2ff.). The paraphrase by Gorgias
which Reinhardt quotes is not indeed conclusive evidence against the
negative. It runs:
What is cannot have corme into being. If it did, it came either from what is
or what is not. But it did not come from what is, since if it is existent it did
not come to be but already is; nor from what is not, for the non-existent
cannot generate anything.
This makes the two halves of the argument symmetrical, but the last
clause looks like a rewording of v. 12 in its accepted form, and indeed
affords some support for the translation given above as against that of
Cornford.* If one would wish the negative away, it is because it
scarcely seems consistent with the dialectical power elsewhere displayed
by Parmenides that be should first rebut the generation of what is out
of what is not by the vigorous assertion that ‘ what is not” cannot even
be mentioned, and then follow this with an unnecessary and much
feebler argument that “what is not' can generate nothing but isself.
The reason may be that Parmenides enjoys casting in the teeth of the
cosmogonists something that they themselves had all accepted as

<p>                            ‘What is’ is Timeless
obvious. Ex nihilo nihil fic was an axiom of Greek thought, as Aristotle
remarked. ‘Generation from the non-existent is impossible; in this
opinion all the natural philosophers concur’ (Phys. 187a34).
If however ». 12 does begin the argument that ‘what is cannot
<p>originate from what is’, it continues satisfactorily. The decision is
implicit in what has gone before: the only alternatives are to be and
not to be, and the latter has been rejected.       Hence being can only be
thought of in the present. Whatever the reading and meaning of ». 12,
this must be the argument of the following lines. As Simplicius
interprets, after quoting the passage (Phys. 78.24): ‘This he clearly
demonstrates about true being, that it is not generated; neither from
something existing, for no existing thing preceded it, nor from the
non-existent, for the non-existent is nothing.’
The imperishability of what is is not so explicitly argued, but follows
<p>clearly enough from the exclusive alternatives ‘it is’ and ‘it is not’ and
the absolute rejection of the latter ; for to suppose that what is can perish
is to suppose that at some future time it will be possible to say of it ‘it
is not’, This serves also as an additional argument against its generation,
since the denial that ‘it is’ cannot be entertained for past time any
more than future, In fact past and future have no meaning in or for
reality (. 5), which adds force to the subsidiary argument of v, 9
and 1o: even supposing that something could come from nothing,
what could cause this to happen at any particular time rather than
another?
Here is a second major intellectual achievement, comparable both
<p>intrinsically and in its influence on later philosophy to the distinction
between    sensible     and intelligible, namely   the   distinction   berween
time and eternity, the recognition of eternal as a separate category
from everlasting. To conceive of something as merely everlasting
is to set it in time,   One says that just as it is now, so it was thousands
of years ago and will be in the future. But for the eternal “was” and
‘will be* have no meaning, and the time-sequence is abolished.
Thus Plato taught that the physical universe was as old as time (it
‘has been and is and shall be perpetually through all time’), but it
is not eternal (&amp;d105). It lives through days and nights, months and
years, and
                                    29
<p>                                      The Eleatics
all these are parts of time, and ‘was’ and ‘shall be’ are forms of time that
have come to be; and we are wrong to transfer them unthinkingly to eternal
being. We say that it was and is and shall be; but ‘is” alone really belongs
10 it....That which is for ever in the same state immovably cannot be
becoming older or younger by the lapse of time, nor can it ever become 50;
neither can it now have been, nor will it be in the future.”
For all Plato’s greater maurity of thought and resources of expres-
<p>sion, it is difficult to overestimate his debt to the man who first had the
intellectual vision to say of ‘what is’: ‘It was not in t le past, nor yet
shall it be, since it now is all together
The eternity (in the sense of imperishability) of the (ine reality had
<p>of course been asserted by the Milesians, Anaximanderiapplied to his
apeiron the epithets deathless, imperishable, ageless. At the same time
he claimed that there arose in it, by “separation’, the nucleus from
which the world grew. What Parmenides points out is that if reality is
eternal and is one, then it could never have become the starting-point
(arche) of a manifold world. But its eternity and its unity must be
accepted. Just as ‘what is’, had it been generaied, would have had to
come out of whar is not, so would any other being; and this is im-
possible.    Hence the real is not only eternal but unique.                     This does
away with any idea of aliving and growing universe, such as both
Milesians and Pythagoreans had described. The time element in the
world of men’s imagination is emphasized, in contrast with reality,
in fr. 19: “Thus in appearance these things come into being and
now are, and having matured will come to an end in the future; and
for them men have assigned a name to distinguish each one.” If
something is, there can be nothing                  surrounding        it (mepiéxov), no
reservoir of fresh substance on which it can feed, like the apeiron
around the gonimon of Anaximander or the ‘infinite breath’ sur-
rounding the ‘seed” of the Pythagorean cosmos. Even more patently
illusory is the multiplicity of existing things in which the ordinary
unthinking man believes. All alike are confounded by the simple
dilemma here propounded by Parmenides, which Aristotle has sum-
  ¥ Tim. 38c2-3, 376-382 (wrans. Cornford). Frankel's stgument that Parmenides’s words do
nOT express the same distncnon has not convinced me (Wege w. Formen, 151, n. 1), In parncular
the addition of wore in +. § seems rather to emphasize the negation of past and furure than to
qualify it in any way.</p>

points I da not fallow Owen's taterpreation. In particular he seetns to regard che recoguitian
of any imphcut reference in Parmenides to earlier cosmologists as an accusauon of ‘resting his
argument” on their assumptions, or as ‘sedd/ing it with a subject from earlier cosmology®, and so
inconsistent with ks greatness as ‘a radical and conscious pioneer” (iid. 93, 95). This may be fair
criticiso of some parts of Cotnford’s interpretation, but is nor a reason for excluding practically
any allusion 1o the cosmologsts from the Way of Truth. It is just us pushing of their premises
10 a logical conclusion which allows him 10 make a clean break with them and shows what a
radical pioneer he was.

‘Way of Truth but several times in the Seeming. This may be so, but does it prove anything? In
denying that truth is in the opinions of mortals, Parmenides is very tikely to deny it in their owa
phraseology.</p>
 The evidence that Parmenides, in his criticisms of earlier thought,
<p>had Heraclitus especially in mind, is cumulative. It is pelevant there-
fore to compare the denial in {r. 4 of any scattering or dra‘;v‘mg together,
and the assertion that things absent are to the mind) present, with
Heraclitus’s statement as given by Plutarch (fr. 91): ‘it scatters and
again draws together, it approaches and goes away.” T hé indivisibility
of reality in 8.22 may also remind us of Heraclitus’s description of his
method at the beginning of his work (fr. 1): ‘ Dividing each thing and
showing how it is.
 Fr. 4 begins by exalting the capacity of mind, or insight (evidently
<p>as contrasted with the senses), t6 make far-off things present. The
ground for this was already prepared, in that the function of the noos
as early as Homer included the summoning-up                                of things distant in
space or time,<em> but for Parmenides the omnipresence which the mind
perceives is an objective reality. The senses suggest that some things
are here, some there, and that they move away from or draw towards
each other, just as Heraclitus had said (indeed he spoke of them doing
both at once), and this separation and conjunction had been held to
account for the natural order (cosmos). In truth there can be no cosmos,
for order implies the arrangement of more than one unit, and reality is
a single, continuous whole. If we follow the goddess’s advice to
ignore the senses and judge by reason, we shall see that being can never
be separated from itself.
The lines 8. 22—5 argue for the indivisibility and continuity of being,
<p>both of which were mentioned in the preliminary list of vv. 5-6. Since
the sole choice lies between ‘It is’ and ‘It is not’, there are no degrees
in being: ‘It must either fully be or else not be’ (». 11). Up to now,

</em> A surposing number of scholars see a reference to Anaaimenes here. This seems far-
ferched,
* Cf. von Fritz in CP, 1943, 91. He cites ZL 15.80f., which describe the noos of a much-
<p>travelled man ‘darting swiftly’ over the lands he has seen.

<p>                   ‘What is’ is Full: There is no Void
 the only form of being conceivable had been corporeal being. Hence
 when Parmenides for the first time makes explicit (in order to show up
 its logical absurdity) the idea of degrees of being, these have to be
 understood as degrees of density, which makes the language of these
 lines more intelligible. The lack of homogeneity which would result
 from ‘what is” existing more or less might cause it to fall apart and be
 divided.   Strict adherence to the premise that ‘it is’ fochids this: ‘All
 is (equally) full of what is’, an undifferentiated continuurn.
 By this argument too any cosmogony of the Milesian                                type,
<p> from a single arche, is dismissed as impossible.                      If Anaximander’s
 apeiron were really a uniry, without internal distinctions, then no
 internal distinctions could have appeared in it. For a cosmos to
 emerge, there must have been some unevenness of texture, some
 lack of homogeneity or equilibrium in it to start with. The con-
 densation and rarefaction of Anaximenes’s world-process are similarly
 ruled out.
 In the claim that what exists is indivisible and continuous, with no
<p> interstices between separate bits of being, ‘for what is is close to what
 is’, we have Parmenides’s denial of the void. This had been a feature
 pacticularly of the Pythagorean world-system. It separated the units
 out of which the world was built, and which were thought of at the
 same   time    as arithmetical       units, geometrical          points,    and   physical
 particles. In its physical manifestation, as thar which separated the
 smallest particles, the Pythagoreans identified it with air, that air which
 the cosmos breathed in from the surrounding infinite in order to separ-
 ate the bodies within it.' It is evident that eaclier and contemporary
 thinkers were still far from grasping the notion of empty space or
;’vacuum. Parmenides faced them with it, and showed that on their own
  ‘monistic premises it was an impossible conception. Since being was
  still imagined as something physical and tangible, empty space conld
 _only be found where being was not. But where being is not, there
  can only be non-being, i.e. empty space is non-existent. So great
  and lasting was the impact of this revolationary thought that when
 Leucippus and Democritus wished later to affirm the existence of
 space they could only do so in the form of an audacious paradox—

<p>                                Divine Sanctions in Parmenides
    from Homer.          One of these, telling how ‘Fate fettered’ reality and
    made it motionless (v. 37), could not fail to recall to areader the dramatic
    moment when ‘ Fate fettered” Hector to stand still (ueiven) outside the
    walls of Troy when the rest of the Trojans had fied like deer within the
    city, and so to meet Achilles and his death. Other words and phrases
    also keep the poetry on the same high plane” For reality to be im-
    petfect would be contrary to right ordinance (themis). Necessity and
    Fate, Ananke and Moira, were in Parmenides’s day mighty personal
    beings, of whom Ananke appears also in the second part of the poem.
    Just as here she holds the one being in the bonds of a peirar, and her
    companion Moira fetters it to be unmoved (vv. 37-8 below), so in the
   world as it appears to mortals she herself “fetters’ or compels the heaven
   10 hold the peiraze of the stars (10.6). Whatever the relation between
   the two worlds of reality and seeming, the language of each is designed
   to remind us of the other; and the Ananke who controls the sky and the
   stars is the same cosmic goddess who in Plato’s Republic holds the
   spindle on which all the circles of the stars revolve. This cosmic
   Ananke appears again in an Orphic theogony known to the Neo-
   platonists, where she is ‘stretched out aver the whole casmos, reaching
   10 its limits (perara)’.* The religious intensity of the passage, and its

  &quot; imitatorem antiqui carminis Orphici esse Hieronymum® (Kern, De theogg. 33). That Plato was
 “ ,acquainted with the Orphic theoganies appears from his references to them, e.g. Philedus, S6¢,
    where he quotes 2 Line verbatim.
<p>                                           The Eleatics
allusion to the traditional functions of Ananke, must not be set aside
any more than the fact that the whole exposition is a revelation from a
goddess.
 To turn to the argument, Parmenides here asserts with all the force
<p>aof language at his command that reality is totally immaovable. This is
the explanation promised by the occurrence of the same characteristic
(&amp;rpepés) in the preliminary list (. 4). Yet it may be asked how
Parmenides thinks he has proved, or here proves, that reality is un-
moved in the sense of staying in the same place (v. 29). The banishment
of becoming and perishing substantiates only the impossibility of
beginning       or ceasing. According to Frinkel, abser{e of kinesis
(“motion’)      in Greek includes changelessness, but even if this is correct
(on which point see vol. 1, 382), what is needed is the converse: a
demonstration that changelessness includes absence of locomotion. On
the other hand Parmenides has just shown, in the immediately preced-
ing lines, that reality is one and indivisible, homogeneous and continu-
ous, and ‘ail is full of being’. So his reason is not far to seek. If all
that exists is @ single continuous plenum, there is nowhere for it to
move as @ whole, nor has it any parts which could change places
internally.<em>
The complete immobility of the real, the impossibility of kinesis in
<p>any sense of the word, is for Parmenides the climax of his message.
Hence no doubt the compelling grandeur of his language at this point.
' This pbvious explanation was generally accepted until Frinkel propounded his alternative
<p>view, He argues that locomation is a kind of change, and all change involves the illegitimate
cancept of coming-to-be and passing-away. But this is to import much that Parmenides does not
say, nor is the involvement of coming-ta-be and destruction in any act of locomotion at ali obvious
without explanation, The argument is certainly one which Parmenides could have put forward
on his owa premuses: the movement of anything implies that it goes to where it ‘was not” before,
and that it ‘is not’ now where it formerly was; and since ‘is not” is unthinkable, motion in space
is also inconceivable. But if this is what he wished us to understand at this point, he has lafta
great deal to his reader’s imagination,
Two English scholars, G. S. Xark and M. C. Stokes, have recently pur forward a view based

finds no support in the fragments of Parmenides and auribute it to a superficial reading of Plato,

<p>                               Immability and Peirata
Solemn thetoric and the intraduction of the great goddess Ananke
have their part in persuading us no less than logie, for, as other fifth-
century poets sang, ‘ The might of Ananke is invincible’, and no charm
or spell can prevail against her.™ He has also deliberately called up in
our minds the image of Xenophanes’s paatheistic god, who ‘always
remains in the same place, not moving at all’, only adding a little to
the emphasis of the language.? Parmenides’s thought was stimulated
by this spherical cosmic divinity, which neither moved from place to
place nor was subject to generation and destruction; but his logic
advanced the concept of motion and change still further and denied it
validity in all its forms, Afier him the way was paved for the all-
embracing concept of kinesis which we find in Aristotle, with its four-
fold division into locomotion, growth and diminution, qualitative
alteration, and generation and destruction.3
These lines also introduce a notion that was clearly of great import-
<p>ance for Parmenides, that of a peirar or peiras (pl. peirata). These are
epic and poetic forms of a word which in its prose form peras is already
familiar, especially in the account of Pythagoreanism.                             Its contrary
apeiron we first met as the arche of Anaximander. The epeiron is the
unbounded or indefinite, and peras is usually translated ‘limit’. In
Parmenides peiras falls again and again on our ears with the force of
ablow. Reality is in the peirata of great bonds (v. 26): Ananke holds
it in the bonds of a peiras (v. 31): there is an ultimate peiras (v. 42): it
lies within its peirata (v. 49). Even in the world as it appears to erring
mortals, Ananke constrains the heavens to hold the peirasa of the stars
(r0.7).
The reversal of dative and genitive between vv. 26 and 31 suggests
<p>that peirata and desmoi (bonds) are interchangeable, and this is con-
sistent with the use of peirer in Homer and the epic tradition.4 The

divine infant Apollo, says the Homeric hiymn in his honour, soon burst
his swaddling bands: ‘No longer did the bonds hold thee back, and all
the peirata were loosed.” When the companions of Odysseus bound
him to the mast, that he might listen to the Sirens in safety, they fastened
the peirata around it. In Hesiod peirata are the coils of the serpent
within which it guards the golden apples of the Hesperides. The
constant notion is that of encirclement: so again Oceanus, imagined as
a circular river girdling the earth, is called its peirar in t}‘Ee Iliad, and a
later poer says that by flowing round the earth it dindsjit.* Progress
from a concrete to an abstract sense being more likely thap             the reverse,
we may take it that peirer first meant a material bond, a rppe or chain.
Of course in the fifth century peras was in common use with no other
meaning than ‘limit’, whether in a spatial, temporal or more abstract
sense; but Parmenides is writing in the epic tradition, as one steeped
in the language and thought of Homer and Hesiod, and the point may
prove to have some importance.
   The argument for confining all reality within peirare seems to be
this. What is apeiron is essentially unfinished, incomplete, never a per-
fect whole however much of it one may include. But reality cannot be
incomplete. That would mean that to some extent it “was not’, but, as
we know, one cannot qualify not-being as ‘to some extent’ or ‘in some
respect’: the only choice is between is and is not. ‘Is lacking’ is
equivalent 10 ‘is not’, hence if it were not it would be Jacking altogether.
In some such way one may perhaps explain the difficult lines 32-3.
   In this short passage Parmenides has further advanced his intellectual
revolution on two fronts. The denial of change and motion condemns
all human experience as illusory and once again excludes the possibility
of any cosmogony; and the insistence that reality is totally confined
within peirata destroys specifically the basis of Anaximander’s system.
   To appreciate the tremendous impact of Parmenides it is necessary
to anticipate by an occasional forward glance at his great successor
Plato. In addition to points already noted, a comparison of Plato’s
descriptions of ‘what really exists’ with those of Parmenides leaves no
doubt about the historical origin of some elements in his thought. Two
examples will suffice. At Phaedo 78d we read concerning ‘each thing

in itself which is, the existent (7o 5v)’, that ‘being of one form it remains
by itself, constant and the same, and never admits of any alteration in
any respect whatsoever’. This unchanging reality a man may only
grasp in full clarity with his mind (65¢, €), “not employing sight in his
thinking nor dragging in any other sense along with his reasoning’,
 for sight and heating hold no truth for men (65b). Then there is the
 Timaeus (27d):
 In my opinion we must first of all make the following distinction : what is it
 that always is and has no becoming, and what on the other hand becomes
 continually and never is? The one comprebensible by the mind with reason-
 ing, the other conjectured by opinion with irrational sensation, coming to be
 and passing away, but never really being.
 The metaphysical concept of immutable being, and the epistemological
 contention that knowledge is only explicable as a contact of the mind
_ with an actual, stable and non-sensible object of knowledge, are corner-
 stones of Platonism. Although it does not go the whole way with
 Parmenides, yet without him bath its metaphysic and its theory of
 knowledge might have been very different.

                (d) Recapirulation: coming-into-being, locomotion and
                          alteration are names without content

 thought.        Nothing exists or can exist apart from what is, since Fate has

  There are thus, apart from minor diffecences, cwa main lines of interprecation. Qne (of which
Vlastos is the chief modern advocate; see Gnamon, 1953, 168) involves the identity of thought
and being; according to the other (which is foltowed here) the line zepeats what has been said
already in fr. 2.6-8 and fr. 3, namely that it is impossible to think (votiv) what is hot: there is no
thought without an existing object. In Mansfeld’s translation (Qffenbarung, 65) the sequence of
thought does not seem to me altogether clear,                                R

   These eight lines are usually, and rightly, regarded as a recapinilation
of the main conclusions already reached about the nature of reality,
followed by a full and explicit statement, also largely but not entirely
recapitulation, of their anaihilating effect on all that is customarily
thought real, They may be paraphrased thus, All thonght must have
a real object.         One cannot apprehend (know, recognize: the verb is
still noein) something in the mind without an apprehension of its
 existence (cf. 2.7-8), for thought depends on ‘what is’—a real object
 ——for its fulfilment, unfolding or expression. This real object is unique,
 whole and unmoved. Tt follows that coming into being and perishing
 (which involve the conjunction of being with not being), movement in
 space, and change of quality are all unreal. Contrary to the firm belief
 of those who utter these ‘names’; they are mere words standing for

                            Names without Realiry
  nothing real. This is repeated at the end of the second part of the poem,
  where the goddess, having described a physical, pluralized cosmos,
  concludes (fr. 19):
  Thus according to appearance these things have arisen and now are, and as
  they have grown will end in time to come; and men have laid down               a
  distinguishing name for each of them.
     For Parmenides there is no contradiction in the idea that the erring
  faculties of mortals should coin names which correspond to no reality,
  although it is impossible ‘to think or utter that which is not’. When
  men’s mouths produce the terminology of change, they are literally
  ‘saying nothing’ (oUBtv Aéyouct), nor can they be said to noein what
  is not; there is no act of noein at all. Of English words, noein in this
  cortext seems to signify ‘meaning’ as much as any other. Since mortals
 name the other things which are not real, it might be supposed that
  they must zhink about them; but what they utter is mere names without
 content, meaningless words. It implies no recognition or grasping,
 since it is only a naming of unreal things. To see a logical difficulty
 here, Plato had to stand on Parmenides’s shoulders and employ
  resources of thought and language which were scarcely at his disposal.
  The guestion of appearing and seeming without being, and of things being
 spoken yet not being true—all this is still full of perplexity as it has always
  been in the past.   It is terribly difficult to see in what terms you can say or
¢ think that falsehoods have a real existence, without being canght in contra~
  diction whent you open your mouth (Sopt. 236¢).
     The question whether names were ‘natural’ or ‘conventional’, a
  strange one to us, became lively in the late fifth century. Like many of
  the puzzles which the Sophists enjoyed, it had its roots in Parmenides.
7 His own answer is explicit. The names given to things in the world of
  experience cannot be ‘in nature’; not simply, as one might think,
  because they were mere conventional labels attached to things which
  might just as well be called something else (as it is a matter of where a
  man was born whether he calls a particular substance wood or éois);
  but because there is no real object at all for them to be attached to.
     The limitations imposed by his pioneer situation provide also the
  most likely answer to those who argue chat he consciously and deliber-
  ately identified thought with being, and hence what thinks with what

is: his one reality anticipates Aristotle’s god in being engaged in purely
intellectual activity: ‘ Eleatic Being is mind’ (Vlastas}. Apact from f.
8.34 and fr. 3, which have here been translated differently, Vlastos
relies on the indirectargument that the thought which knows can hardly
be denijed existence. Hence it must be at least a part of being (for being
is unique), and since being is ‘all alike’ it cannot be a part of being
without being the whole of ir.! Fortunately we possess practically the
whole of the Way of Truth, and can say with some                                gpnfidence that
Parmenides nowhere states this train of thought; and it is dangerous o
put arguments into his mouth, even if from our point of, view they are
an inescapable consequence of what he does say. It should suffice to
remark that in attempting to explain his theory of human knowledge,
both Vlastos and others rely heavily on fr. 16 as expressing his own
sincerely held view. But fr. 16 speaks of 2 ‘mixture’ of elements in the
human frame and obviously belongs to the Way of Seeming.                                      The
mixture must be composed (as is generally agreed) of the two primary
contraties of the cosmology described in this part of the poem, namely
fire or light (the rare) and night or darkness (the dense): of these ‘that
which prevails is thought” (16.4; see on this fr. pp. 67 f. below).
The critics may be right in supposing that Parmenides meant this
seriously as an explanation of how mortal minds can err; that is scarcely
something that could be accounted for on the assumption of one un-
changing reality. Atany rate it is not so accounted for, and Parmenides
does not seem to have regarded the plurality involved as fatal to the
validity of his explanation. Yet it is a more violent contradiction of the
unity of heing than we need assume here, if we suppose him to have
acquiesced in the idea that it is possible to think about ‘what is” with-
out advancing to the rather sophisticated conclusion that “what is’
must itself be thinking. He was not that kind of idealist.?
  * Groman, 1953, 168.
  * Comford s on this point a better guide. Cf. Pfoto and Parm. 34,n. 1: ‘He nowhere suggesrs
that his One Being thinks, and no Greek of his date or for long afterwards wonld have seen any-
thing but nonsense in the statement that *“A exists” means the same as “A thinks”. ... Parmenides
cerzainly held that there can be no thought withaut ag object that 15; but nothing in the poem sup-
ports the interpretation that thinking (s the same thing as its objeet.” Mr G. Jameson has acutely
pointed out the error of confusing an explicit statement that thought and its object are identical
with the primitive inability to distinguish berween the two (Phronesis, 3958, 22£. Cf.alsn Owen,

     The one new point in this summary is the denial that what is can
  change colour. The example of colour no doubt stands for qualitative
* change in general, and it is introduced along with generation and perish-
    ing, being and not being, without further comment.                               Such alteration
    would indeed be immediately recognized in his time as a special case of
    becoming. There was as yet no awareness of a distinction between sub-
    stance and quality. Either therefore one may say that the same thing
    (the coloured object) is and is not (i.e. is white and not white, no
    difference being felt between the predicative and existential uses of the
    verb; this is the ambiguity                 that was afterwards              exploited by          the
    Sophists) or, what more probably represents the early fifth-century
    outlook, the same thing (i.e. the colour white) 7s when the object is
* characterized by it, and zs nor(disappears) when the object changes colour.
     On either supposition, if alteration takes place the same thing is not and
    is, ot is other than what is—moreobviously so thanin change of place—
    so that its impossibility would not seem to be in need of separate
    demonstration.”

argument. The originality of this procedure, and the intellecrual power
required to initiate ir, may easily escape us from their familiarity in
later writing. While giving them due acknowledgment, we need not
assume that this great pioneer was capable at one bound of unfolding a
lengthy argument according to strict rules of inference. Sometimes
a clause made dependent on another through a ‘for’ or a ‘since’ is
little more than a repetition in different words; sometimes it expresses
the conclusion in a religious or metaphorical form. Thus at v. 29
reality remains firmly in the same place, for Ananke holds it in the bonds
of 2 peiras; and in v. 48 it hardly adds a cogent reason for the uniformity
of being to say ‘since it is all inviolate’. (The adjective, asyfon, whence
comes our noun asylum, signifies protection from violent attack or
robbery.)

ing the novelty and difficulty of his doctrine, he was wise to do. Here
we have in essentials the statement of »v. 23 and 24 over again, that
what is cannot be in greater or less degree in one direction or another.
The expression is varied slightly, but with Parmenides’s conception of
reality, ‘greater or smaller’ means the same. In the earlier passage it
followed that it ‘held together’ and was a continuous plenum. Here
it is said that there are no intervals of not-being to separate portions
of homogeneous being.
   The crux of the passage lies in the question how to interpret the
reference to spherical shape and the spatial language of ‘equal every
way from the centre’. Are the ‘furthest limit’, and the limits which it
                                               44
                                   ¢ Like a Round Ball’
 ‘meets uniformly’ (or alternatively ‘within which it rests’), limits of
 spatial extension?         How, in short, did Parmenides conceive of his one
 true being? As purely conceptual, or as occupying space?
    Certain things about it are beyond doubt. Itisgrasped by intellectual
 insight, not by the senses.           [tis immutable and timeless, neither changing
 in quality nor moving in space. It is unique, completely homogeneous,
 and indivisible. All this shows plainly that it is not a body filling space
 with its physical bulk as, say, the earth does.
    From these certainties some have concluded that the peirara on
 which such repeated emphasis is laid, and which hold reality so firmly
 in the grip of their bonds, have nothing to do with spatial limits but are
 used figuratively to signify the invariancy of the one being. The refer-
 ence to a chain that ‘hems it in” or ‘constricts it all round’ is purely
  metaphorical, even though (which makes this position a little difficult)
  it is brought in as the immediate explanation of why reality, like the
. god of Xenophanes, remains always in the same place. On the same
 argument vv. 42—3 do not say, as they seem to, that ‘what is’ has
 boundaries and is spherical, but only that it is spatially, as it bas been
 said to be temporally, invariant.              Effectively, space has been abolished,
 as time was abolished by the denial of past and future. Reality is com-
 paed to a sphere simply ‘because there is nothing true of it at one
. point or in one direction which is not true elsewhere,                       Its uniformity is
 like the perfect balance of a ball about its centre.”
     1 believe that the linking of peirata, encircling bonds or limits, with
 spatial contexts has more significance than this. The temporal situation
 is different, in fact diametrically contrary. If ‘what is” is to exist com-
 pletely at every moment, and never for one moment not to exist in any
 sense or to any extent, then it must have no temporal limits; and the
 idea of a reality without temporal limits was not strange to Parmenides,
     ' This, if understand him rightly, is the position taken up by Owen in his masterly article in
  CQ, 1960, from which the last sentence is quoted. But I see Parmenides through such different
  spectacles that T am seriously afraid of misrepresenting him. In any case the force of his argument
 wan only he appreciated at length and in his own words. He justly calls attention to the insur-
 mountable difficulty of expression which confronted Parmenides ‘ The very proof which rules
 oue all vacianon in time and space has to use language which implies temporal and spatial
 distinctions. It has to say that what exists is continuous. .. ; and that it remains the same; and
  that it is uniform in all directions. Just as Parmenides can only prove the unintelligbility of
 olx domw by himself denying the existence of certain sates of affairs, sa he can only show the
 wvacilousness of temporal and spatial disiinctions by a proof which employs them® (p. 120).

having already been mooted by a thinker to whom he owed much,
Xenophanes. If on the other hand it had no spatial limirs, then accord-
ing to the ideas of the time it would zever exist completely. As he says
in vy. 29f.: ‘It xemains firmly where it is, for Ananke holds it in the
bonds of a peiras that confines it all round, because what is must not be
incomplete,” Similarly in v1. 42-3, ‘Since thete is a furthest limit, it is
complete on every side, like a round ball”,
   The difficulty of 2 modern interpreter is that he fe¢ls himself con-
fronted with only two alternatives: either something goes on for ever
indefinitely, or where it stops there must be somethin'% else, or at the
least empty space, beyond it; whereas for Parmenide§ there is only
‘what is” and nothing else, not even empty space, for that is ‘what is
not’.    How then can what is Jie within peirara, except in the meta-
phorical sense of being invariant? It appears for instance to Owen
that if we 1ake the sphericity of reality seriously, we must suppose
Parmenides to be using the argument from continuity, which in vy,
22—5 was used 1o prove that there is no part of reality that borders on
nothing, ‘to prove that reality does border on nothing in all directions
at an equal distance from a centre’.
   This would have seemed strange nonsense to Parmenides. It
depends on a Euclidean conception of space as infinite which had not
yet penetrated the Western consciousness.! The question: *If all that
exists is finite and spherical, what lies beyond it?’ is one which he had -
no impulse to ask himself. (It was first raised by Melissus; see p. 107
below.) If, anachronistically, we ask it for him, we must reply that
there is neither something (for all existence is contained within it) nor
nothing (for nothing does not exist and cannot even be imagined).
The All of Parmenides is more Iike the curved and finite Einsteinian
space than the Euclidean conception which still dominates our ordinary
thinking.* Plato speaks of ‘your thinkers like Melissus and Parmenides °
who assert that everything is one and stands still within its own .
boundaries because it has no room in whick ir moves® (Theaet. 180€).
  ! See Comford, The lnvention of Space (1938).

    It was a typically Hellenic idea, fraught with momentous and some
 would say dire consequences for science, that a special uniqueness and
 perfection attached 1o roundness, including spherical shape in solid
 bodies and circularity in surfaces or motion. What impressed the Greek
 was the way in which a single line or surface turned back upon itself
 completely, so that, as Heraclitus said (fr. 103), * Beginning and end are
 common’, and could be assumed at any point on it. To Alemaeon this
 had a mysterious connexion with human life.” Xenophanes had already
 connected it with divinity, and it was most commonly summed up in
 the epithet ‘ perfect’ or *complete” (teleion). The perfection of the circle
 and sphere was basic to the cosmologies of Plato and Aristotle, from
 which was born the whole progeny of stellar spheres which haunted
 the world down to and beyond the time of Copernicus, so that even
 he was too much under its spell to see that his own hypothesis had
 turned it into useless lumber.
     The cosmos, said Plato, is spherical because the sphere is ‘ the most
 perfect and self-consistent (or uniform) of shapes’. Nothing went out
 or came into it from anywhere, ‘since there was nothing’ (Zim.
  33b, ¢). No one but Parmenides himself had the logjcal stubbornness
 to reject the testimony of his own eyesight completely and deny every
  form of motion, but both Plato and Aristotle deferred to him so far as
    to emphasize the fact that the sphere is the only shape whose motion
- (revolution) can occur without requiring any space outside it. Aristotle
  + also, in applying the term ‘perfect’ to the sphere, defines it as meaning
    “that outside which there is nothing’, in contrast to the apeiran, of
 . which however much you may take, there is always somethmg left
 outside; and he calls the sphere the primary figure because it ‘cor-
 responds to unity’, being bounded by one continuous surface. The
 .perfection and ‘wholeness’ of a circle are similarly connected with its
  unity as a line.
     Above all, for both Plato and Aristotle there was nothing whatso-~
    * Seevol. 1, 351 .   Parmenides himself had a circle in mind when he wrote (fr. §): *Itis all one
  (bt “common"") 10 me whence I begin, for thither I shall come back again.” The position of this
" fragment in the poem, and hence its precise application, are quite uncertain; but although we
  know it only from one rention in Proclus, it scems a little drastic t0 question its genuineness as
  Jameson does (Phranesis, 1958, 20£.), Most probably it refers o the description of the one Being
. in the Way of Truth: starting from any of the ofperra (8.2), the goddess can amive a1 any of the
* others (Mansfeld, Offendarung, 106).

ever outside the spherical cosmos, and this excluded empty space (or
‘nothing’ in the Parmenidean sense) as well as matter. Aristotle is quite
explicit: * There is neither place nor void nor time outside the heaven.
   We may cite Plato and Aristotle on this point without fear of
anachronism. In the first place, all that needs to be shown is the bare
possibility of conceiving the whole of reality as spherical without ask-
ing the question whether or not it ‘borders on nothing’. Secondly,
the language of Plato in many places makes it clear that in teaching the
perfection and completeness, the uniformity and self—sdtﬂiciency of the
sphere he was directly under the sway of Parmenides. {He had indeed
advanced, but the advance consisted in the ability to separate the
noetic world of pure, intelligible form from every spatial association.
At each step he had either to satisfy the conditions laid down by
Parmenides or justify his departure from them.
    What then was in the mind of Parmenides?                           It may be helpful to
 recall his well-attested acquaintance with Pythagorean thought.
 According to the Pythagoreans there was void both inside and outside
 the cosmos. Internally it is what keeps things apart; externally it is
 the ‘“infinite breath’ which the cosmos draws in for its nourishment and
growth.? The process of cosmogony consisted in general terms of the
imposition of limit on this unlimited. This scheme of things Parmenides
 denied point by point. Internally there is nothing that keeps things
 apart, since reality is one and continuous: “what is is close to what is’. -
Nor is there anything outside, whether it be called void or breath.
 That assumption was only justified so long as the universe was sup-
posed to need an external source on which to draw, that is, so long as
it was incomplete. But ‘it is not allowed that what is should be in~ .
complete, for it is ot lacking’. There is no unlimited (apeiron); the
peirata embrace all that is; and this ‘unlimited” which Parmenides has
abolished was at the same time physical matter, empty space, and time
or duration. To do away with it was an audacious stroke, aimed it

   * Ar. Phys. a13b22:* The Pythagoreans also said that void exists, and that it enters the universe
from the infinite breath, the universe being supposed to breathe in the actual void, which keeps
different kinds of things apart’; and again in his On the Pythagoreans, bk. 1 (ap. Stob.: see DK,
val. 1, 460.1): * The universe is unique, and from the infinite it draws in time, breath, and void
which distinguishes the places of separate things.” For further details see vol. 1, 280.

 would seem primarily at the Pythagoreans, but also a lever wherewith
  to overthrow every normal person’s conception of reality.                                It is no
 wonder that he hammered it home with the fourfold repetition of
 peiras, backed up with the insistence on bonds and fetters imposed by
 divine authority.
     Now we know, chiefly from the repeated criticisms of Aristotle, that
  the Pythagoreans, excited by the discovery of the part played by
  mathematical laws of proportion and harmony in the ordering of the
  cosmos, and guided by impulses religious as well as scientific, declared
  outright that ‘things are numbers’.                    ‘Granted that spatial magnitude
  consists of these elements [sc, limited and unlimited, odd and even, the
  elements of number], how could some bodies be heavy and some light?*
  ‘When they construct physical bodies out of number. . . they appear to
  be talking about some other universe and other bodies, not those that
 ‘we perceive.” ‘From the monad and the unlimited spring numbers,
 " from numbers points, from points lines, out of which surfaces are
  formed, out of surfaces solid figures, and from these, perceptible bodies.’*
  In this last leap, from the geometrical solid to physical nature, they
! betrayed the primitivism still lurking in their thought, and it was on
  this that Parmenides pounced. The cosmos, which like most of us they
  believed 1o be real, was for them a sphere, containing other spheres
 within it, all of them revolving, and all containing visible and tangible
  body, composed of fire, water, air and earth.                      Parmenides retained the
  geometrical basis of all this, but denied the illegitimate leap from the
  intelligible geometrical figure 10 the moving and perceptible world.
  His reality is the spherical solid of the geometer, now for the first time
  separated from its physical manifestations, an object of thought, not
   ense.     It is one,       continuous,         homogeneous,           motionless,        timeless,
 ' ﬁnished and complete.            Extended in space?            No more and no less than
   the figures of which Enclid supplies definitions at the beginning of the
   various books of the Elements.

   Simglicius (Phys. 31. 8) supposed thae the errorof mortals fay in fatling to seethat it s impossible
to posit one of a pair of physical apposites without the other. The Greek therafore means *of
which it is not right €0 name oaly one”. Some modern schalass have followed him, e.g. Coxon
writes (CQ, 1934, 142):
                      * We see now why Parmenides deliberately assumed two first principles
instead of one. Qut of a single element nothing can came but itself, since,in the absence of anything
else, it must always be completely uniform.’ KR too translate: *of which they must not name one
only’, and remark that this is the difference between objects of reason and objects of sense:
according to reason only one of a pair of opposites can be accepted; according to sense it is
impossible to accept one without the other, Similarly Diés and Raven, P. and E. 39. Verdenius
{Parm. 61-3) also says that two forms, not one only, must be named, but argues that this con
demnation comes not from the goddess but from mortals themselves,

 (Od. 19.203). 1do not see how Verdenius can know that to have the meaning probable, plausible,
 or only apparent which it has in Plato, owéta would at this earlier period need to be followed by
 adadive.      In thus line, surely, the goddess announces the nature of the subject-matter of the second
 part of the poem in the same way as 1t is summed up at the end (fr. 19): “Thus according to

     Imperturbably pursuing her argument, the goddess now declares
. that she has said all that can be said about what truly exists.                              She has
 described a reality to which none but a disembodied mind could con-
  fine its attention, something utterly different from the world in which
  each one of us, including Parmenides, supposes himself to live, and
: which none of us can ignore if he is 10 continue living, Henceforward
  Parmenides, the uniquely privileged mortal who has journeyed through
+the gates of the paths of Night and Day, will know our world for the
 . deceitful show that it is. Nevertheless it is possible to understand and
     terpret it either well or badly, for appearances do not presenta chaotic
   canfusion; indeed our daily life depends on their regularity, and a cursoty
inspection of our surroundings confirms it. They suggest a detailed
 ‘process of ordering or systematization (Siéwoouav), and Parmenides
“must master its principles so that his own understanding of it is better
  than anyone else’s. It is possible to improve on previous cosmogonies.
    The realm of truth is rather like the mathematical mode! or world-
 image of the modern physicist with its relationship to the physical
 world reversed. For some physicists, at least, the model is ‘merely an
 intellectual structure. To a certain extent it is arbitrary.” ‘ The world-

image is due to our imagination and is of a provisional and changeable
character.” This world-image contains only mathemarical magnitudes,
which are perfectly definable but never observable, in contrast to the
physical world which may be observed but never precisely measured
or defined. Reverse the relationships, call the physicist’s model reality
and the physical world a construction of the human intellect and
imagination, and we shall approach very closely to the Parmenidean
ontology. It was an astonishing achievement. Planck had the work of
generations of exact scientists behind hitn when he wrofe that ‘a clear
and consistent distinction between the magnitudes of the world of the
senses and the similarly-designated magnitudes of the world-image is
indispensable’. When we reflect that the need for an analogous distine-
tian was grasped by one man early in the fifth century B.c., even though
the ontological status of the two worlds was reversed, we may begin
to appreciate something of the extraordinary quality of the few pioneer
minds of classical Greece.
   This is the difference between the man who has had the truth
divinely revealed to him and the crowd of mortals who ‘knowing
nothing,     wander two-headed’.             They      confuse being and not-being,
deluding themselves that ‘ things that are not are’. He has the distinc-
tion ever present in his mind.             For him therefore it is legitimate to go
on from reality to study the world of seeming. Once the goddess has
revealed the truth (and she could not have done so more clearly and
emphatically), such study will not mislead him as to its status. Of the
motive for it she says only: ‘that no judgment of mortals may outrun
thee’. His account of appearances will excel those of others.? To ask
‘But if it is unreal, what is the point of trying to give an account of it
at all?” is to put a question that is not likely to have occurred to him.

what he believes it to be (CQ, 1960, 85). Long (Phronesis, 1963, 105£.) accepts Owen’s jnter-
pretation but emphasizes the didactic purpose of such a device. Verdenius on the other hand

                      Truth and Falsehood in Parmenides
divine favour which he enjoys, Parmenides is not a gad. This is not to
water down his logic. There is all the difference in the world between
living and thinking as if the phenomena were real and studying phe-
nomena in the full consciousness of the impassable gulf that separates
them from reality.!
    ‘From solid figures come sensible bodies.” There lay the fatal error
on which Parmenides put his finger, in the supposition that there could
be a transition in nature from the intellectual world of mathematical
form to the world of physical bodies and change, and that both worlds
are on the same level of reality. In that guise it was an error of the
Pythagoreans, and it is scarcely rash to infer that it was reflexion on
their mathemarical conception of physics that led him to his great
discovery.® But the discovery was of course equally fatal to any
 cosmological theory, religious or scientific, which started from the
 dictum universally accepted by early Greek thinkers and ascribed by
 them to their ancient poet and religious teacher Musaeus: ‘All things
 came into being out of one, and are resolved into one’ (D.L. 1.3).
 From unity nothing but unity can be derived. The first step in describ-
 ing the evolution of a cosmos, with all its ordered variety, must be to
 name ‘two forms’;3 but since reality has been proved to be one, this
   * At frst glance a reader may be reminded of the cosmic illusion of Maya in Indian thought
 It too can be described as ‘the imposition of a multiple and mutable unreality upon a sole and
 unique immutable   Real’ (Sri Aurobindo    in S. Radhakrishnan    and C. A. Moore,     4 Source Book
 in Indian Phdosophy, p. 595   see his whole section, ‘ The Power of Illusion, Maya’, pp. 5§89-97),
 and more pacticularly as ‘the realm of the phenomenal pairs of opposites’ (H. Zimmer, Philo~
 saphies of India, 440). In fact, hawever, [ndia and Parmenides are poles apart. Parmenides makes
 and tests his hard-and-fast distinctions by sheer intellectual reasoning (/ogos), which is for him
  the sole purveyor of truth. In Brahmanism, not only the senses but *thought, the intellect itself,
- must be transcended if true reality s to be attained. Logic is. . .an imperfect, inadequate instru-
 ment for the final insight” (Zimmer, 380). If any Greek thinker were to be brought into com-
 parison with Indian ideas, ic might rather be Herachtus.     Sankhya and Yoga, at any rate, speak
 of ‘the identity of apparently incompatible elements, representing a union of things which on the
 logical level exclude each other’. There is “a constant transformation of things into their anu-
 theses—antagonism being but the screen of a cryptic identity. Behind the screen the contending
 farces are in harmony” (Zimmer, 313),

 background of their thought, are 50 utterly different from those of the Greeks that there is lirtle

immediately shows up the illusory character of such a world. With this
final warning the goddess praceeds to her account of the origin and
present arrangement of phenomena.
   This phrase from . 74 (‘of which it is not right to name one”) neatly
illustrates the difficulty which Parmenides had in using the language at
his disposal to express himself clearly, for it has been seriously under-
stood as meaning () that zwo forms should be named (i.e. not one
only), (4) that one should not be named and the other;should, (¢) that
none should be named (i.e. not ever one). An attractive interpretation
is that of H. Frinkel. Of two forms, one should not «}Ce narned. This
does not mean that one of the two forms about 20 be destribed is illegiti-
mate and the other consequently legitimate, i.e. that Light exists though
Night does not, for Light is not to be identified with the one being of
the Way of Truth, even if there turns out to be a certain analogy
between them.           It means simply that men name two forms when it is
right to name only one, to wit being, or ‘what is’. This is in fact
ueither of the two that mortals do name, which have not yet been given
their titles or characteristics. The initial mistake lies in naming two
forms ar all* 1 should like to believe that Frankel's explanation is
correet, but cannot rule out the alternative that if one accepts the world
of appearances then it is necessary to posit two ultimate forms to account
for its genesis. On this interpretation Parmenides is claiming that it is
illogical to suppose simultaneously (@) that there is a world containing
many different things, (4) that this pluraliry arose from a single arché.
This conviets all (and they were not anly philosophers) who had sup-
posed that ‘all things arose from one’,? and that the opposites (which
they did posit) were derivative.

   * Cf. vol. 1, 69. In this way, as Deichgraber and Mansfeld have pointed out (see Offendarung,
 140 and 145), Parmenides has some claim to be regarded as the discoverer of the concept of an
 arreducible element which was developed by Empedocles.

                The Two Forms. Aristote’s Interpretation
    So far we have been dealing, for the first time, with a section of a
 philosopher’s work of which the greater part has survived, and have
 been freed from the irksome necessity of extracting his thought to a
 large extent from second-hand accounts and eriticisms. What has been
 said up to this point about the ways of truth and seeming and their
 relation to each other is what seems most probable from a reading of
 his own words.? 1t is interesting nevertheless to see that it is close to
 the interpretation of Aristotle. His general attitude to Parmenides was
 one of condescension: he was certainly mistaken, and his mistakes arose
 from trying to indulge in abstract argument before the principles of
 logic had been sufficiently well developed: the faults common to him
 and his school (Aristotle thought) were inexperience and lack of prac-
 tice in the techniques of reasoning which they were irying to use. At
 the same time Aristotle singles out Parmenides as more intelligent and
 profound than the others. He ‘saw further’ (Metaph. 986b27);
 ‘Parmenides must be thonght to have spoken better than Melissus’
 (Phys. 207a15); the premises of both Parmenides and Melissus were
 false, and their arguments invalid, ‘ but Melissus’s account is cruder and
 presents no difficulty” (i6id. 185a9).
     Aristotle saw as clearly as any modern critic that only the doctrine
 of ‘one being” contained the truth for Parmenides, and that the physical
 world of plurality and change was simply false.
 ‘Convinced      that, beside what is, what is not is nothing, of necessity he
 supposed that one thing exists, namely what is, and nothing else’ (Metaph.
 986b 28).
    ‘Some earlier philosophers, e.g. Melissus and Parmenides, flatly denied
_generation and destruction, maintaining that nothing which is either comes
- into being or perishes; it only seems to us as if this happens® (De caelo
 208b1g)
 . “They say that no existing thing either comes into being or perishes
 because what comes into being must originate either from what exists or
 from what does nor, and both are impassible: what is does not become (for
 it already is), and nothing could come to be from what is not’ (Phys.
  1912 27).
   * Of course notall will agree. The status of the “way of seeming is a highly controversial topic,
 0 much so that to distuss the various theones of it put forward in the ninetesnth and rwentieth
 centuries would not only be intolerably long but inevitably cloud the 1ssue. A view rather
 similar to the one put forward here is given by Mugler in L' Ane, Class, 1958, 8o.

                                       The Eleatics
Again, in a criticism of Plato:
    ‘But if there is to be an absolute Being and an absolute Unity, it is ex-
wemely      difficult to see how       there will be anything else besides; how, 1
mean, existing things can be more than one. What is other than what is does
not exist, so that the argument of Parmenides will necessarily apply, that
everything that exists is one, namely “what is”’ (Metaph. 1001 a 29).
   Yet in his work On Corming-to-be and Perishing he makes statements
like these:                                           i
‘ Those who start with two things, as Parmenides did wf‘th fire and earth,
make the intermediates mixrures of these’ (330b13) and { Parmenides says
there are two things, what is and what is not, which he calls fire and earth’
(318b 6).

   The link between these contradictory statements, as he sees it, he
gives in the continuation of 2 passage from the Metaphysics already
quoted (986b31). Parmenides, he says, necessarily believed that ane
thing and one thing only exists,
but being compelled to follow appearances, and supposing thar what existed
was one by definition” but more than one according to sensation, he restores
two causes and two principles, hot and cold, meaning fire and earth.                         Of
these he ranks the hot with what is* and the cold with what is not.
   Aristode’s interpretation of Parmenides was, then, first, that reality
is one, unchanging and eternal; secondly, that the account described
as “the beliefs of mortals’ is an attempt to bring system and coherence
into the world of appearances after an initial insistence that it is unreal;
and thirdly, that this account is his own.                   No ancient critic, indeed,
makes any suggestion that it might be either a synthesis of exisring
ideas (whether common-sense or philosophical) or a repetition of a
particular scheme such as the Pythagorean. Aristotle also makes a
fourth point. Both here and in the work On Coming-to0-be and Perishing
(318h6, quoted above) he sees, probably in a part of the ‘way of
  ¥ xardk Tév Adyov, Aéyes does multiple duty in Greek and cannot be adequately represented
by a single English equivalent, (Cf. vol, 1, 420ff.) In Aristotle, *definition” was a frequent
meaning, and may have been uppermost in his mind here. But the introduction of the word
suggests also, as he no doubt intended, Parmenides's own use of it, as in 7.5 xpivan Adyc,
The only legitimate procedure is to judge by fogos (deductive reasoning), and the contrast of it
here with afognais brings out the inability of sensation ta make contact with the eeuth,

         seeming’ now lost,” an affinity between one of the two contrary first
         principles and ‘what is” and between the other and ‘ what is not’. This
         seems to be an attempt to bridge the gulf between the two parts of the
         poem, though what the connexion is, and whether he is correct in
         assuming that Parmenides made it, is as yet by no means clear. This
         will need further investigation, but the other three points accord well
         with the impression given by the extant verses of Parmenides himself.

                                      (9) Cosmogony and cosmology
'        (Fr.9)      Then since all things have been named Light and Night, and the
         names appropriate to their powers assigned to these and those, everything
         is full alike of Light and obscure Night, both equal, since there is nothing
         that shares in neither.
         These lines are perhaps not perspicuous at first sight.   Light (or fire) and Nighe (or darkness) are
         each self-identical (8.57—9), and becween them they include the whale range of pecceptible
      contrary qualities: Lighe carries with it hot, rare, light (as opposed to heavy), etc., and Night cold,
      dense, heavy, etc. Thus everything in the physical world is ranged under one or other of these two,
    . since everything consists of 2 corbination of opposites: the moment 2 primary pair 1s posited
         (instead of the one being which truth demands), it pervades the whole wotld, since every physical
         object must be characterized by an opposite or opposites.        (‘Nothing shares in neither.”) The
    * names assigned to the various powers (i.e. qualities) signify no more than $o many manifestations
         of the basic pair Light and Nighr,
    .       This explanation is not far from Frankel's (Wege n. Formen, 180£.), It gives a clear and co~
        - herent argument, which is not easily obtained from a translation of the final words as “neither has
         any part in the other’ (Cornford) or ‘neither has any share of nothingness® (KR); also Mansfeld,
          Qffenbarung, 156: ‘Keines von beiden Anteil hat an Nichts.” Frinkel shaws also that his version
         gives 1o MeTeival its most usual and natural meaning,
            v. 2. Swvdpmg, Qualities were regularly thought of at this time as actve powers, from their
         effect on the senses or the physical state of 2 body, as ‘the hot’ can heat it, ‘the heavy’ can make
         it sink. See further Cornford, P. and P. 47 with n. 2.
            ¥, 4. Yowv. I see no reason for denying that this refers to equality of quantity or extent as
          Bignone thoughr, Frankel js emphatic tha it does not, and translares it by ‘gleichwertig’. So
          also Coxon, CQ, 1934, 141, ‘equal in status’. But one may compare the Pythagorean commen»

             Of the section dealing with the origin and structure of the cosmos we
          have only a few brief fragments, which cannot, even with the aid of
          secondary sources, yield anything like a complete picture. It begins
          with the ‘two forms’, which are not Parmenides’s own invention, but,
             * Cherniss, here as on most points, recommends an attitude less favourable 10 Aristotle than

as the goddess says, what mortals have already decided to posit. We
shall expect them therefore to reflect current views on the primary
opposites. Fr. 9 makes it clear thar each of these is, as it were, the
heading of a list, the two lists making up between them all sensible
qualities and things (‘Everything is called Light and Night’), ranged
in pairs of contraries. The fragments themselves give rare and dense
(recalling Anaximenes), light and heavy (8. 57 and §9), male and female,
right and left (fir. 32.§ and 17), and of these the last two pairs, as well
as light and darkness themselves, appear in the similarly parallel
Pythagorean list of contraries given by Aristotle.! The intelligible
itemns in that list (unity, limit, odd and their contrarieé) naturally do
not appear, since Parmenides is confining himself to the sensible
world and has demonstrated the impossibility of bringing the two
together.
    Aristotle and the doxography add the pairs hot and cold (though
it is scarcely an addition to say that fire is hot), and soft and hard, and
meation earth as an alternative to Night or darkness in contrast with
Fire.* Peripatetic language also classified the Parmenidean contraries
as active and passive respectively. Theophrastus spoke of ‘two prin-
ciples, fire and earth, one serving as matter, the other as cause and
maker’ (a7). Aristotle would doubtless have said the same. When in
the Metaphysics (986b34) he speaks of Parmenides as positing ‘hot
and cold, meaning fire and earth’, he calls these ‘ causes and principles’,
and one may assume that in relation to his own scheme of causation he
would class the one as efficient (Toiodv) and the other as material cause
(or wdoyov).
   Both the equation of darkness with earth and the division into active
and passive are commonly regarded as anachronisms on the part of
Aristotle and his followers, but they are no more than a restatement in
their own terms of a very old belief common to the philosophy and
mythology of the period before Parmenides. Tt goes back to the idea

divine infant Apollo, says the Homeric hiymn in his honour, soon burst
his swaddling bands: ‘No longer did the bonds hold thee back, and all
the peirata were loosed.” When the companions of Odysseus bound
him to the mast, that he might listen to the Sirens in safety, they fastened
the peirata around it. In Hesiod peirata are the coils of the serpent
within which it guards the golden apples of the Hesperides. The
constant notion is that of encirclement: so again Oceanus, imagined as
a circular river girdling the earth, is called its peirar in t}‘Ee Iliad, and a
later poer says that by flowing round the earth it dindsjit.<em> Progress
from a concrete to an abstract sense being more likely thap             the reverse,
we may take it that peirer first meant a material bond, a rppe or chain.
Of course in the fifth century peras was in common use with no other
meaning than ‘limit’, whether in a spatial, temporal or more abstract
sense; but Parmenides is writing in the epic tradition, as one steeped
in the language and thought of Homer and Hesiod, and the point may
prove to have some importance.
The argument for confining all reality within peirare seems to be
<p>this. What is apeiron is essentially unfinished, incomplete, never a per-
fect whole however much of it one may include. But reality cannot be
incomplete. That would mean that to some extent it “was not’, but, as
we know, one cannot qualify not-being as ‘to some extent’ or ‘in some
respect’: the only choice is between is and is not. ‘Is lacking’ is
equivalent 10 ‘is not’, hence if it were not it would be Jacking altogether.
In some such way one may perhaps explain the difficult lines 32-3.
In this short passage Parmenides has further advanced his intellectual
<p>revolution on two fronts. The denial of change and motion condemns
all human experience as illusory and once again excludes the possibility
of any cosmogony; and the insistence that reality is totally confined
within peirata destroys specifically the basis of Anaximander’s system.
To appreciate the tremendous impact of Parmenides it is necessary
<p>to anticipate by an occasional forward glance at his great successor
Plato. In addition to points already noted, a comparison of Plato’s
descriptions of ‘what really exists’ with those of Parmenides leaves no
doubt about the historical origin of some elements in his thought. Two
examples will suffice. At Phaedo 78d we read concerning ‘each thing

in itself which is, the existent (7o 5v)’, that ‘being of one form it remains
by itself, constant and the same, and never admits of any alteration in
any respect whatsoever’. This unchanging reality a man may only
grasp in full clarity with his mind (65¢, €), “not employing sight in his
thinking nor dragging in any other sense along with his reasoning’,
 for sight and heating hold no truth for men (65b). Then there is the
 Timaeus (27d):
 In my opinion we must first of all make the following distinction : what is it
 that always is and has no becoming, and what on the other hand becomes
 continually and never is? The one comprebensible by the mind with reason-
 ing, the other conjectured by opinion with irrational sensation, coming to be
 and passing away, but never really being.
 The metaphysical concept of immutable being, and the epistemological
 contention that knowledge is only explicable as a contact of the mind
_ with an actual, stable and non-sensible object of knowledge, are corner-
 stones of Platonism. Although it does not go the whole way with
 Parmenides, yet without him bath its metaphysic and its theory of
 knowledge might have been very different.</p>

<p> These eight lines are usually, and rightly, regarded as a recapinilation
of the main conclusions already reached about the nature of reality,
followed by a full and explicit statement, also largely but not entirely
recapitulation, of their anaihilating effect on all that is customarily
thought real, They may be paraphrased thus, All thonght must have
a real object.         One cannot apprehend (know, recognize: the verb is
still noein) something in the mind without an apprehension of its
 existence (cf. 2.7-8), for thought depends on ‘what is’—a real object
 ——for its fulfilment, unfolding or expression. This real object is unique,
 whole and unmoved. Tt follows that coming into being and perishing
 (which involve the conjunction of being with not being), movement in
 space, and change of quality are all unreal. Contrary to the firm belief
 of those who utter these ‘names’; they are mere words standing for
                                              40
<p>                            Names without Realiry
nothing real. This is repeated at the end of the second part of the poem,
where the goddess, having described a physical, pluralized cosmos,
concludes (fr. 19):
Thus according to appearance these things have arisen and now are, and as
they have grown will end in time to come; and men have laid down               a
distinguishing name for each of them.
For Parmenides there is no contradiction in the idea that the erring
<p>faculties of mortals should coin names which correspond to no reality,
although it is impossible ‘to think or utter that which is not’. When
men’s mouths produce the terminology of change, they are literally
‘saying nothing’ (oUBtv Aéyouct), nor can they be said to noein what
is not; there is no act of noein at all. Of English words, noein in this
cortext seems to signify ‘meaning’ as much as any other. Since mortals
 name the other things which are not real, it might be supposed that
they must zhink about them; but what they utter is mere names without
 content, meaningless words. It implies no recognition or grasping,
 since it is only a naming of unreal things. To see a logical difficulty
 here, Plato had to stand on Parmenides’s shoulders and employ
resources of thought and language which were scarcely at his disposal.
The guestion of appearing and seeming without being, and of things being
 spoken yet not being true—all this is still full of perplexity as it has always
been in the past.   It is terribly difficult to see in what terms you can say or
¢ think that falsehoods have a real existence, without being canght in contra~
diction whent you open your mouth (Sopt. 236¢).
The question whether names were ‘natural’ or ‘conventional’, a
<p>strange one to us, became lively in the late fifth century. Like many of
the puzzles which the Sophists enjoyed, it had its roots in Parmenides.
7 His own answer is explicit. The names given to things in the world of
experience cannot be ‘in nature’; not simply, as one might think,
because they were mere conventional labels attached to things which
might just as well be called something else (as it is a matter of where a
man was born whether he calls a particular substance wood or éois);
but because there is no real object at all for them to be attached to.
The limitations imposed by his pioneer situation provide also the
<p>most likely answer to those who argue chat he consciously and deliber-
ately identified thought with being, and hence what thinks with what

<li><p>34 and fr. 3, which have here been translated differently, Vlastos
relies on the indirectargument that the thought which knows can hardly
be denijed existence. Hence it must be at least a part of being (for being
is unique), and since being is ‘all alike’ it cannot be a part of being
without being the whole of ir.! Fortunately we possess practically the
whole of the Way of Truth, and can say with some                                gpnfidence that
Parmenides nowhere states this train of thought; and it is dangerous o
put arguments into his mouth, even if from our point of, view they are
an inescapable consequence of what he does say. It should suffice to
remark that in attempting to explain his theory of human knowledge,
both Vlastos and others rely heavily on fr. 16 as expressing his own
sincerely held view. But fr. 16 speaks of 2 ‘mixture’ of elements in the
human frame and obviously belongs to the Way of Seeming.                                      The
mixture must be composed (as is generally agreed) of the two primary
contraties of the cosmology described in this part of the poem, namely
fire or light (the rare) and night or darkness (the dense): of these ‘that
which prevails is thought” (16.4; see on this fr. pp. 67 f. below).
The critics may be right in supposing that Parmenides meant this
seriously as an explanation of how mortal minds can err; that is scarcely
something that could be accounted for on the assumption of one un-
changing reality. Atany rate it is not so accounted for, and Parmenides
does not seem to have regarded the plurality involved as fatal to the
validity of his explanation. Yet it is a more violent contradiction of the
unity of heing than we need assume here, if we suppose him to have
acquiesced in the idea that it is possible to think about ‘what is” with-
out advancing to the rather sophisticated conclusion that “what is’
must itself be thinking. He was not that kind of idealist.?

<p> In these few lines the conjunction ‘for’ occurs three times, and
*since’ twice: a striking example of what is apparent                            throughout the
poem, the ordering of its contents in the guise of a forma! deductive
argument. The originality of this procedure, and the intellecrual power
required to initiate ir, may easily escape us from their familiarity in
later writing. While giving them due acknowledgment, we need not
assume that this great pioneer was capable at one bound of unfolding a
lengthy argument according to strict rules of inference. Sometimes
a clause made dependent on another through a ‘for’ or a ‘since’ is
little more than a repetition in different words; sometimes it expresses
the conclusion in a religious or metaphorical form. Thus at v. 29
reality remains firmly in the same place, for Ananke holds it in the bonds
of 2 peiras; and in v. 48 it hardly adds a cogent reason for the uniformity
of being to say ‘since it is all inviolate’. (The adjective, asyfon, whence
comes our noun asylum, signifies protection from violent attack or
robbery.)
 Parmenides does not hesitate to repeat himself, as indeed, consider-
ing the novelty and difficulty of his doctrine, he was wise to do. Here
we have in essentials the statement of »v. 23 and 24 over again, that
what is cannot be in greater or less degree in one direction or another.
The expression is varied slightly, but with Parmenides’s conception of
reality, ‘greater or smaller’ means the same. In the earlier passage it
followed that it ‘held together’ and was a continuous plenum. Here
it is said that there are no intervals of not-being to separate portions
of homogeneous being.
 The crux of the passage lies in the question how to interpret the
reference to spherical shape and the spatial language of ‘equal every
way from the centre’. Are the ‘furthest limit’, and the limits which it
                                          44
<p>                                   ¢ Like a Round Ball’
 ‘meets uniformly’ (or alternatively ‘within which it rests’), limits of
 spatial extension?         How, in short, did Parmenides conceive of his one
 true being? As purely conceptual, or as occupying space?
  Certain things about it are beyond doubt. Itisgrasped by intellectual
 insight, not by the senses.           [tis immutable and timeless, neither changing
 in quality nor moving in space. It is unique, completely homogeneous,
 and indivisible. All this shows plainly that it is not a body filling space
 with its physical bulk as, say, the earth does.
  From these certainties some have concluded that the peirara on
 which such repeated emphasis is laid, and which hold reality so firmly
 in the grip of their bonds, have nothing to do with spatial limits but are
 used figuratively to signify the invariancy of the one being. The refer-
 ence to a chain that ‘hems it in” or ‘constricts it all round’ is purely
metaphorical, even though (which makes this position a little difficult)
it is brought in as the immediate explanation of why reality, like the
<ol>
<li>god of Xenophanes, remains always in the same place. On the same
 argument vv. 42—3 do not say, as they seem to, that ‘what is’ has
 boundaries and is spherical, but only that it is spatially, as it bas been
 said to be temporally, invariant.              Effectively, space has been abolished,
 as time was abolished by the denial of past and future. Reality is com-
 paed to a sphere simply ‘because there is nothing true of it at one
<ol>
<li>point or in one direction which is not true elsewhere,                       Its uniformity is
 like the perfect balance of a ball about its centre.”
 1 believe that the linking of peirata, encircling bonds or limits, with
 spatial contexts has more significance than this. The temporal situation
 is different, in fact diametrically contrary. If ‘what is” is to exist com-
 pletely at every moment, and never for one moment not to exist in any
 sense or to any extent, then it must have no temporal limits; and the
 idea of a reality without temporal limits was not strange to Parmenides,
 ' This, if understand him rightly, is the position taken up by Owen in his masterly article in
CQ, 1960, from which the last sentence is quoted. But I see Parmenides through such different
spectacles that T am seriously afraid of misrepresenting him. In any case the force of his argument
 wan only he appreciated at length and in his own words. He justly calls attention to the insur-
 mountable difficulty of expression which confronted Parmenides ‘ The very proof which rules
 oue all vacianon in time and space has to use language which implies temporal and spatial
 distinctions. It has to say that what exists is continuous. .. ; and that it remains the same; and
that it is uniform in all directions. Just as Parmenides can only prove the unintelligbility of
 olx domw by himself denying the existence of certain sates of affairs, sa he can only show the
 wvacilousness of temporal and spatial disiinctions by a proof which employs them® (p. 120).</li>

having already been mooted by a thinker to whom he owed much,
Xenophanes. If on the other hand it had no spatial limirs, then accord-
ing to the ideas of the time it would zever exist completely. As he says
in vy. 29f.: ‘It xemains firmly where it is, for Ananke holds it in the
bonds of a peiras that confines it all round, because what is must not be
incomplete,” Similarly in v1. 42-3, ‘Since thete is a furthest limit, it is
complete on every side, like a round ball”,
 The difficulty of 2 modern interpreter is that he fe¢ls himself con-
fronted with only two alternatives: either something goes on for ever
indefinitely, or where it stops there must be somethin'% else, or at the
least empty space, beyond it; whereas for Parmenide§ there is only
‘what is” and nothing else, not even empty space, for that is ‘what is
not’.    How then can what is Jie within peirara, except in the meta-
phorical sense of being invariant? It appears for instance to Owen
that if we 1ake the sphericity of reality seriously, we must suppose
Parmenides to be using the argument from continuity, which in vy,
22—5 was used 1o prove that there is no part of reality that borders on
nothing, ‘to prove that reality does border on nothing in all directions
at an equal distance from a centre’.
 This would have seemed strange nonsense to Parmenides. It
depends on a Euclidean conception of space as infinite which had not
yet penetrated the Western consciousness.! The question: <em>If all that
exists is finite and spherical, what lies beyond it?’ is one which he had -
no impulse to ask himself. (It was first raised by Melissus; see p. 107
below.) If, anachronistically, we ask it for him, we must reply that
there is neither something (for all existence is contained within it) nor
nothing (for nothing does not exist and cannot even be imagined).
The All of Parmenides is more Iike the curved and finite Einsteinian
space than the Euclidean conception which still dominates our ordinary
thinking.</em> Plato speaks of ‘your thinkers like Melissus and Parmenides °
who assert that everything is one and stands still within its own .
boundaries because it has no room in whick ir moves® (Theaet. 180€).

It was a typically Hellenic idea, fraught with momentous and some
 would say dire consequences for science, that a special uniqueness and
 perfection attached 1o roundness, including spherical shape in solid
 bodies and circularity in surfaces or motion. What impressed the Greek
 was the way in which a single line or surface turned back upon itself
 completely, so that, as Heraclitus said (fr. 103), <em> Beginning and end are
 common’, and could be assumed at any point on it. To Alemaeon this
 had a mysterious connexion with human life.” Xenophanes had already
 connected it with divinity, and it was most commonly summed up in
 the epithet ‘ perfect’ or </em>complete” (teleion). The perfection of the circle
 and sphere was basic to the cosmologies of Plato and Aristotle, from
 which was born the whole progeny of stellar spheres which haunted
 the world down to and beyond the time of Copernicus, so that even
 he was too much under its spell to see that his own hypothesis had
 turned it into useless lumber.
 The cosmos, said Plato, is spherical because the sphere is ‘ the most
 perfect and self-consistent (or uniform) of shapes’. Nothing went out
 or came into it from anywhere, ‘since there was nothing’ (Zim.
33b, ¢). No one but Parmenides himself had the logjcal stubbornness
 to reject the testimony of his own eyesight completely and deny every
form of motion, but both Plato and Aristotle deferred to him so far as
to emphasize the fact that the sphere is the only shape whose motion</p>
</li>
<li>(revolution) can occur without requiring any space outside it. Aristotle</li>
<li>also, in applying the term ‘perfect’ to the sphere, defines it as meaning
“that outside which there is nothing’, in contrast to the apeiran, of
 . which however much you may take, there is always somethmg left
 outside; and he calls the sphere the primary figure because it ‘cor-
 responds to unity’, being bounded by one continuous surface. The
 .perfection and ‘wholeness’ of a circle are similarly connected with its
unity as a line.
 Above all, for both Plato and Aristotle there was nothing whatso-~
<ul>
<li>Seevol. 1, 351 .   Parmenides himself had a circle in mind when he wrote (fr. §): *Itis all one

" fragment in the poem, and hence its precise application, are quite uncertain; but although we
know it only from one rention in Proclus, it scems a little drastic t0 question its genuineness as

ever outside the spherical cosmos, and this excluded empty space (or
‘nothing’ in the Parmenidean sense) as well as matter. Aristotle is quite
explicit: * There is neither place nor void nor time outside the heaven.
 We may cite Plato and Aristotle on this point without fear of
anachronism. In the first place, all that needs to be shown is the bare
possibility of conceiving the whole of reality as spherical without ask-
ing the question whether or not it ‘borders on nothing’. Secondly,
the language of Plato in many places makes it clear that in teaching the
perfection and completeness, the uniformity and self—sdtﬂiciency of the
sphere he was directly under the sway of Parmenides. {He had indeed
advanced, but the advance consisted in the ability to separate the
noetic world of pure, intelligible form from every spatial association.
At each step he had either to satisfy the conditions laid down by
Parmenides or justify his departure from them.
  What then was in the mind of Parmenides?                           It may be helpful to
 recall his well-attested acquaintance with Pythagorean thought.
 According to the Pythagoreans there was void both inside and outside
 the cosmos. Internally it is what keeps things apart; externally it is
 the ‘“infinite breath’ which the cosmos draws in for its nourishment and
growth.? The process of cosmogony consisted in general terms of the
imposition of limit on this unlimited. This scheme of things Parmenides
 denied point by point. Internally there is nothing that keeps things
 apart, since reality is one and continuous: “what is is close to what is’. -
Nor is there anything outside, whether it be called void or breath.
 That assumption was only justified so long as the universe was sup-
posed to need an external source on which to draw, that is, so long as
it was incomplete. But ‘it is not allowed that what is should be in~ .
complete, for it is ot lacking’. There is no unlimited (apeiron); the
peirata embrace all that is; and this ‘unlimited” which Parmenides has
abolished was at the same time physical matter, empty space, and time
or duration. To do away with it was an audacious stroke, aimed it</p>

 would seem primarily at the Pythagoreans, but also a lever wherewith
to overthrow every normal person’s conception of reality.                                It is no
 wonder that he hammered it home with the fourfold repetition of
 peiras, backed up with the insistence on bonds and fetters imposed by
 divine authority.
Now we know, chiefly from the repeated criticisms of Aristotle, that
<p>the Pythagoreans, excited by the discovery of the part played by
mathematical laws of proportion and harmony in the ordering of the
cosmos, and guided by impulses religious as well as scientific, declared
outright that ‘things are numbers’.                    ‘Granted that spatial magnitude
consists of these elements [sc, limited and unlimited, odd and even, the
elements of number], how could some bodies be heavy and some light?<em>
‘When they construct physical bodies out of number. . . they appear to
be talking about some other universe and other bodies, not those that
 ‘we perceive.” ‘From the monad and the unlimited spring numbers,
 " from numbers points, from points lines, out of which surfaces are
formed, out of surfaces solid figures, and from these, perceptible bodies.’</em>
In this last leap, from the geometrical solid to physical nature, they
! betrayed the primitivism still lurking in their thought, and it was on
this that Parmenides pounced. The cosmos, which like most of us they
believed 1o be real, was for them a sphere, containing other spheres
 within it, all of them revolving, and all containing visible and tangible
body, composed of fire, water, air and earth.                      Parmenides retained the
geometrical basis of all this, but denied the illegitimate leap from the
intelligible geometrical figure 10 the moving and perceptible world.
His reality is the spherical solid of the geometer, now for the first time
separated from its physical manifestations, an object of thought, not
 ense.     It is one,       continuous,         homogeneous,           motionless,        timeless,
 ' ﬁnished and complete.            Extended in space?            No more and no less than
 the figures of which Enclid supplies definitions at the beginning of the
 various books of the Elements.

of some ather renderings. So also Burnet, Gilbert, Kranz, Albertelli, Vlastos., Reinhardt (Paret.
70) also says chat the error of mortals is to name two forms instead of one only, but gives thus a
peculiar tovist; this does ot mean, he says, that one of them is nearer to true being than the other.
Nestle with some justificatian calls his interpretation far-fecched and capricious.
Cornford (CQ, 5933, 508 .3 P. and P. 46) prefesved o rendes ‘of which 1c is not nght to name
(s0 much as) one’.   He repeated Diels’s objection (Lekrgedichr, 03) that Zeller’s version would

would more naturally be represented by o08t e and that of Simplicius and KR by wlew pévaw. In

‘would be misleading, but I may be wrong. Cf. Long, Phronesis, 1963, 98.
 Simglicius (Phys. 31. 8) supposed thae the errorof mortals fay in fatling to seethat it s impossible
to posit one of a pair of physical apposites without the other. The Greek therafore means <em>of
which it is not right €0 name oaly one”. Some modern schalass have followed him, e.g. Coxon
writes (CQ, 1934, 142):
               
</em> We see now why Parmenides deliberately assumed two first principles
instead of one. Qut of a single element nothing can came but itself, since,in the absence of anything
else, it must always be completely uniform.’ KR too translate: *of which they must not name one
only’, and remark that this is the difference between objects of reason and objects of sense:
according to reason only one of a pair of opposites can be accepted; according to sense it is
impossible to accept one without the other, Similarly Diés and Raven, P. and E. 39. Verdenius
{Parm. 61-3) also says that two forms, not one only, must be named, but argues that this con
demnation comes not from the goddess but from mortals themselves,

 described a reality to which none but a disembodied mind could con-
fine its attention, something utterly different from the world in which
each one of us, including Parmenides, supposes himself to live, and
: which none of us can ignore if he is 10 continue living, Henceforward
Parmenides, the uniquely privileged mortal who has journeyed through
+the gates of the paths of Night and Day, will know our world for the
 . deceitful show that it is. Nevertheless it is possible to understand and
terpret it either well or badly, for appearances do not presenta chaotic
<p> canfusion; indeed our daily life depends on their regularity, and a cursoty
inspection of our surroundings confirms it. They suggest a detailed
 ‘process of ordering or systematization (Siéwoouav), and Parmenides

than anyone else’s. It is possible to improve on previous cosmogonies.
  The realm of truth is rather like the mathematical mode! or world-
 image of the modern physicist with its relationship to the physical
 world reversed. For some physicists, at least, the model is ‘merely an
 intellectual structure. To a certain extent it is arbitrary.” ‘ The world-

image is due to our imagination and is of a provisional and changeable
character.” This world-image contains only mathemarical magnitudes,
which are perfectly definable but never observable, in contrast to the
physical world which may be observed but never precisely measured
or defined. Reverse the relationships, call the physicist’s model reality
and the physical world a construction of the human intellect and
imagination, and we shall approach very closely to the Parmenidean
ontology. It was an astonishing achievement. Planck had the work of
generations of exact scientists behind hitn when he wrofe that ‘a clear
and consistent distinction between the magnitudes of the world of the
senses and the similarly-designated magnitudes of the world-image is
indispensable’. When we reflect that the need for an analogous distine-
tian was grasped by one man early in the fifth century B.c., even though
the ontological status of the two worlds was reversed, we may begin
to appreciate something of the extraordinary quality of the few pioneer
minds of classical Greece.
 This is the difference between the man who has had the truth
divinely revealed to him and the crowd of mortals who ‘knowing
nothing,     wander two-headed’.             They      confuse being and not-being,
deluding themselves that ‘ things that are not are’. He has the distinc-
tion ever present in his mind.             For him therefore it is legitimate to go
on from reality to study the world of seeming. Once the goddess has
revealed the truth (and she could not have done so more clearly and
emphatically), such study will not mislead him as to its status. Of the
motive for it she says only: ‘that no judgment of mortals may outrun
thee’. His account of appearances will excel those of others.? To ask
‘But if it is unreal, what is the point of trying to give an account of it
at all?” is to put a question that is not likely to have occurred to him.

what he believes it to be (CQ, 1960, 85). Long (Phronesis, 1963, 105£.) accepts Owen’s jnter-
pretation but emphasizes the didactic purpose of such a device. Verdenius on the other hand
clairs that chis line provides “convincing proof of the positive value which Parmenides attached

divine favour which he enjoys, Parmenides is not a gad. This is not to
water down his logic. There is all the difference in the world between
living and thinking as if the phenomena were real and studying phe-
nomena in the full consciousness of the impassable gulf that separates
them from reality.!
‘From solid figures come sensible bodies.” There lay the fatal error
on which Parmenides put his finger, in the supposition that there could
be a transition in nature from the intellectual world of mathematical
form to the world of physical bodies and change, and that both worlds
are on the same level of reality. In that guise it was an error of the
Pythagoreans, and it is scarcely rash to infer that it was reflexion on
their mathemarical conception of physics that led him to his great
discovery.® But the discovery was of course equally fatal to any
 cosmological theory, religious or scientific, which started from the
 dictum universally accepted by early Greek thinkers and ascribed by
 them to their ancient poet and religious teacher Musaeus: ‘All things
 came into being out of one, and are resolved into one’ (D.L. 1.3).

 and more pacticularly as ‘the realm of the phenomenal pairs of opposites’ (H. Zimmer, Philo~
 saphies of India, 440). In fact, hawever, [ndia and Parmenides are poles apart. Parmenides makes
 and tests his hard-and-fast distinctions by sheer intellectual reasoning (/ogos), which is for him
the sole purveyor of truth. In Brahmanism, not only the senses but *thought, the intellect itself,</li>
<li>must be transcended if true reality s to be attained. Logic is. . .an imperfect, inadequate instru-
 ment for the final insight” (Zimmer, 380). If any Greek thinker were to be brought into com-
 parison with Indian ideas, ic might rather be Herachtus.     Sankhya and Yoga, at any rate, speak
 of ‘the identity of apparently incompatible elements, representing a union of things which on the
 logical level exclude each other’. There is “a constant transformation of things into their anu-
 theses—antagonism being but the screen of a cryptic identity. Behind the screen the contending
 farces are in harmony” (Zimmer, 313),

immediately shows up the illusory character of such a world. With this
final warning the goddess praceeds to her account of the origin and
present arrangement of phenomena.
 This phrase from . 74 (‘of which it is not right to name one”) neatly
illustrates the difficulty which Parmenides had in using the language at
his disposal to express himself clearly, for it has been seriously under-
stood as meaning () that zwo forms should be named (i.e. not one
only), (4) that one should not be named and the other;should, (¢) that
none should be named (i.e. not ever one). An attractive interpretation
is that of H. Frinkel. Of two forms, one should not «}Ce narned. This
does not mean that one of the two forms about 20 be destribed is illegiti-
mate and the other consequently legitimate, i.e. that Light exists though
Night does not, for Light is not to be identified with the one being of
the Way of Truth, even if there turns out to be a certain analogy
between them.           It means simply that men name two forms when it is
right to name only one, to wit being, or ‘what is’. This is in fact
ueither of the two that mortals do name, which have not yet been given
their titles or characteristics. The initial mistake lies in naming two
forms ar all* 1 should like to believe that Frankel's explanation is
correet, but cannot rule out the alternative that if one accepts the world
of appearances then it is necessary to posit two ultimate forms to account
for its genesis. On this interpretation Parmenides is claiming that it is
illogical to suppose simultaneously (@) that there is a world containing
many different things, (4) that this pluraliry arose from a single arché.
This conviets all (and they were not anly philosophers) who had sup-
posed that ‘all things arose from one’,? and that the opposites (which
they did posit) were derivative.</p>

<p>                The Two Forms. Aristote’s Interpretation
  So far we have been dealing, for the first time, with a section of a
 philosopher’s work of which the greater part has survived, and have
 been freed from the irksome necessity of extracting his thought to a
 large extent from second-hand accounts and eriticisms. What has been
 said up to this point about the ways of truth and seeming and their
 relation to each other is what seems most probable from a reading of
 his own words.? 1t is interesting nevertheless to see that it is close to
 the interpretation of Aristotle. His general attitude to Parmenides was
 one of condescension: he was certainly mistaken, and his mistakes arose
 from trying to indulge in abstract argument before the principles of
 logic had been sufficiently well developed: the faults common to him
 and his school (Aristotle thought) were inexperience and lack of prac-
 tice in the techniques of reasoning which they were irying to use. At
 the same time Aristotle singles out Parmenides as more intelligent and
 profound than the others. He ‘saw further’ (Metaph. 986b27);
 ‘Parmenides must be thonght to have spoken better than Melissus’
 (Phys. 207a15); the premises of both Parmenides and Melissus were
 false, and their arguments invalid, ‘ but Melissus’s account is cruder and
 presents no difficulty” (i6id. 185a9).
Aristotle saw as clearly as any modern critic that only the doctrine
<p> of ‘one being” contained the truth for Parmenides, and that the physical
 world of plurality and change was simply false.
 ‘Convinced      that, beside what is, what is not is nothing, of necessity he
 supposed that one thing exists, namely what is, and nothing else’ (Metaph.
 986b 28).
  ‘Some earlier philosophers, e.g. Melissus and Parmenides, flatly denied
_generation and destruction, maintaining that nothing which is either comes
<ul>
<li>into being or perishes; it only seems to us as if this happens® (De caelo
 208b1g)
 . “They say that no existing thing either comes into being or perishes
 because what comes into being must originate either from what exists or
 from what does nor, and both are impassible: what is does not become (for
 it already is), and nothing could come to be from what is not’ (Phys.
1912 27).

</em> Of course notall will agree. The status of the “way of seeming is a highly controversial topic,
 0 much so that to distuss the various theones of it put forward in the ninetesnth and rwentieth
 centuries would not only be intolerably long but inevitably cloud the 1ssue. A view rather
 similar to the one put forward here is given by Mugler in L' Ane, Class, 1958, 8o.</p>

<p>                                       The Eleatics
Again, in a criticism of Plato:
  ‘But if there is to be an absolute Being and an absolute Unity, it is ex-
wemely      difficult to see how       there will be anything else besides; how, 1
mean, existing things can be more than one. What is other than what is does
not exist, so that the argument of Parmenides will necessarily apply, that
everything that exists is one, namely “what is”’ (Metaph. 1001 a 29).
 Yet in his work On Corming-to-be and Perishing he makes statements
like these:                                           i
‘ Those who start with two things, as Parmenides did wf‘th fire and earth,
make the intermediates mixrures of these’ (330b13) and { Parmenides says
there are two things, what is and what is not, which he calls fire and earth’
(318b 6).</p>
<p> The link between these contradictory statements, as he sees it, he
gives in the continuation of 2 passage from the Metaphysics already
quoted (986b31). Parmenides, he says, necessarily believed that ane
thing and one thing only exists,
but being compelled to follow appearances, and supposing thar what existed
was one by definition” but more than one according to sensation, he restores
two causes and two principles, hot and cold, meaning fire and earth.                         Of
these he ranks the hot with what is<em> and the cold with what is not.
 Aristode’s interpretation of Parmenides was, then, first, that reality
is one, unchanging and eternal; secondly, that the account described
as “the beliefs of mortals’ is an attempt to bring system and coherence
into the world of appearances after an initial insistence that it is unreal;
and thirdly, that this account is his own.                   No ancient critic, indeed,
makes any suggestion that it might be either a synthesis of exisring
ideas (whether common-sense or philosophical) or a repetition of a
particular scheme such as the Pythagorean. Aristotle also makes a
fourth point. Both here and in the work On Coming-to0-be and Perishing

    seems to be an attempt to bridge the gulf between the two parts of the

                                 (9) Cosmogony and cosmology
<p>'        (Fr.9)      Then since all things have been named Light and Night, and the
    names appropriate to their powers assigned to these and those, everything
    is full alike of Light and obscure Night, both equal, since there is nothing
    that shares in neither.
    These lines are perhaps not perspicuous at first sight.   Light (or fire) and Nighe (or darkness) are
    each self-identical (8.57—9), and becween them they include the whale range of pecceptible
 contrary qualities: Lighe carries with it hot, rare, light (as opposed to heavy), etc., and Night cold,
 dense, heavy, etc. Thus everything in the physical world is ranged under one or other of these two,
<p>  . since everything consists of 2 corbination of opposites: the moment 2 primary pair 1s posited
    (instead of the one being which truth demands), it pervades the whole wotld, since every physical
    object must be characterized by an opposite or opposites.        (‘Nothing shares in neither.”) The
<p>  * names assigned to the various powers (i.e. qualities) signify no more than $o many manifestations
    of the basic pair Light and Nighr,
<p>  .       This explanation is not far from Frankel's (Wege n. Formen, 180£.), It gives a clear and co~
   - herent argument, which is not easily obtained from a translation of the final words as “neither has
    any part in the other’ (Cornford) or ‘neither has any share of nothingness® (KR); also Mansfeld,
     Qffenbarung, 156: ‘Keines von beiden Anteil hat an Nichts.” Frinkel shaws also that his version
    gives 1o MeTeival its most usual and natural meaning,
       v. 2. Swvdpmg, Qualities were regularly thought of at this time as actve powers, from their
    effect on the senses or the physical state of 2 body, as ‘the hot’ can heat it, ‘the heavy’ can make
    it sink. See further Cornford, P. and P. 47 with n. 2.

        Of the section dealing with the origin and structure of the cosmos we
     have only a few brief fragments, which cannot, even with the aid of
     secondary sources, yield anything like a complete picture. It begins
     with the ‘two forms’, which are not Parmenides’s own invention, but,
        * Cherniss, here as on most points, recommends an attitude less favourable 10 Aristotle than
     that adopted in this book. See ACP, 48, b, 192.

as the goddess says, what mortals have already decided to posit. We
shall expect them therefore to reflect current views on the primary
opposites. Fr. 9 makes it clear thar each of these is, as it were, the
heading of a list, the two lists making up between them all sensible
qualities and things (‘Everything is called Light and Night’), ranged
in pairs of contraries. The fragments themselves give rare and dense
(recalling Anaximenes), light and heavy (8. 57 and §9), male and female,
right and left (fir. 32.§ and 17), and of these the last two pairs, as well
as light and darkness themselves, appear in the similarly parallel
Pythagorean list of contraries given by Aristotle.! The intelligible
itemns in that list (unity, limit, odd and their contrarieé) naturally do
not appear, since Parmenides is confining himself to the sensible
world and has demonstrated the impossibility of bringing the two
together.
  Aristotle and the doxography add the pairs hot and cold (though
it is scarcely an addition to say that fire is hot), and soft and hard, and
meation earth as an alternative to Night or darkness in contrast with
Fire.<em> Peripatetic language also classified the Parmenidean contraries
as active and passive respectively. Theophrastus spoke of ‘two prin-
ciples, fire and earth, one serving as matter, the other as cause and
maker’ (a7). Aristotle would doubtless have said the same. When in
the Metaphysics (986b34) he speaks of Parmenides as positing ‘hot
and cold, meaning fire and earth’, he calls these ‘ causes and principles’,
and one may assume that in relation to his own scheme of causation he
would class the one as efficient (Toiodv) and the other as material cause
(or wdoyov).
 Both the equation of darkness with earth and the division into active
and passive are commonly regarded as anachronisms on the part of
Aristotle and his followers, but they are no more than a restatement in
their own terms of a very old belief common to the philosophy and
mythology of the period before Parmenides. Tt goes back to the idea</em> Metaph. 986a22&gt;    See vol. 1, 245, and of. Comnford, P. and P. 47.

<p>                  Cosmogony in Parmenides: the Opposites
of Earth-mother and Sky-father, according to which (as generally in
early physiology) the mother provides only the material and a place
in which the new life can grow, and the father is the agent which ani-
mates it. He might do this through his fertilizing rain, but even so he
was called Aither (Eur. fr. 839), and the active element was heat rather
than moisture. This is reflected in a famous passage of Plato’s Republic
(s00b), and again when characters in Aeschylus (Cho. 984) and
<ol>
<li>Sophocles (fr. 1017N.) call the sun ‘Father’. The myth related by
Aristophanes in Plato’s Symposizm (190b), that men are offspring of
the Sun and women of the Earth, follows the general pattern of Greek
thoughe in emphasizing the relation of the sexes to the two cosmic
bodies.
 This notion, appearing in various picturesque forms of myth, recurs
in the philosophers both before and after Parmenides. Anaximander
explained the origin of life by the action of the hot and dry ar the
circumference of the cosmos, or more concretely of the sun, on the cold
" and moist at the centre (i.e. the nascent earth, surrounded by aer,
" darkness). The fifth-century zoogony in Diodorus gives a detailed
picture of how life started in moist places under the action of heat.
Empedocles spoke of fire raising up men and women out of the earth
" (and cf. pp. 189, 206 below), Anaxagoras (in the inadequate sketch of
 " Diogenes) of animals born from the moist, the hot and the earthy, and
his pupil Archelaus of their birth from the earth ‘when it had become
hot’. ‘Fire is the universal moving force’ affirmed the writer of the
” Hippocratic De victw. Aristotle truly said that, because the male
 generates in another, the female in herself, ‘ therefore in the universe
 . also men regard the earth as of a feminine nature and the sky and sun
 as procreators and fathers’.?
  It is hardly rash to assume, with Aristotle and Theophrastus, that
 hen Parmenides was constructing a cosmogony according to the
opinions of mortals, and began with two opposed principles Fire (heat,
<ul>
<li>light) and Darkness (cold, earth), he thought of Fire and its correlatives
+"as the active element, and its contrary as the passive. It would no doubt
be possible, if we had the complete poem, to range a whole series of

This order for the two fragments seems probable in view of the way Simpligius introduces fr. 11
(De caelo, 559.20: TT. 8 mept v cdodnTdv Spfaodad gnor Adyew), which suggested to Diels that
fr. 11 is the general intraduction to the sense-world and fr. 10 Introduces the special cosmagony

 These scraps of introduction to cosmogony and cosmology show
<p>that Parmenides described celestial phenomena in detail. But he went
further. After quoting fr. xx Simplicius adds (De caelo, 559.26; DX,
B11): ‘And he? related the evolution of things that come into being and
perish down to the parts of animals’, and Plutarch says (4dv. Col. .
r114b;     DK, Bro) that Parmenides ‘composed                       a cosmic      system and,
mingling the elements Light and dark, out of and by means of these -
produced all phenomena. He has much to say about earth and sky and
sun and moon, and recounts the origin of mankind.” There was also a <em>
theogony, so that Plato could refer casually to the ancient stories of
the gods which Hesiod and Parmenides relate’, and Cicero mentions
that it contained certain deified abstractions on Hesiodic lines—War,
Discord, Love—of which Love alone occuts in an extant fragmentJ3                                      °

This part of the poem must have been of considerable length, and we
have scarcely any quotations from it. Fortunately, although it may
contain some novel features, it is in its author’s eyes a deliberate con~
cession to human weakness: his contribution to philosophy lay else-
where.
Frr. 12 and 13. After quoting the last eleven lines of fr. 8 Simplicius
<p>writes (Phys. 39.12):
‘A little later, having spoken of the two elements, he introduces the creative
power thus (fr. 12.1-3):
“The     natrower [sc. bands, see below] were filled with unmixed                       Fire,
<p>those next to them with Night, but a due portion of flame is injected. And in
the middle of these js the goddess who steers all things.”
This goddess he also makes responsible for producing the gods, saying
<p> fr. 13):
¢ “ F3irst of all gods she devised Eros” and so on.’
Fr. 12, which Simplicius elsewhere quotes entire, continued with
<p>lines (4~6)       showing     that the goddess             mentioned     is in one aspect
Aphrodite goddess of love:
For she it is who has charge of all the concerns of loathed birth and of union,
sending female 10 mingle with male, and again conversely male to female.
It is appropriate therefore that Eros should be her firstborn. Aristotle
<p>classes Parmenides, along with Hesiod, among those who ‘put love
 or desire among things as a first cause (arche)’ (Metaph. 984bz24).
 The only other information about cosmology comes from a con-
<p> densed and disurdered paraphrase of Aétius which may be translated
“thus (2.7.1, A37):
For Parmenides says that there are circular bands wound round one upon
the other, one made of the rare, the other of the dense;® and others berween

It is impossible 10 reconstruct a detailed cosmic order from chis

throw some light on the relation of Parmenides’s cosmology to those

crowns or garlands, is perhaps a reminiscence of Hesiod, who speaks
of </p>

also Anaximander’s rings ot circles of fire surrounded by darkness or
mist (vol. 5, 90, 93). Fr. 12 confirms Aé&amp;tius to the extent that in
Parmenides’s system some were of pure fire, others of fire and darkness
mixed, and that a supreme goddess, who in the old Ionic phrase ‘steers
all things’, occupies a central position.5 Besides being the goddess of
sexual union and birth, she was Ananke (Necessity), who in fr. 10

‘Where rings are concerned, the expression is ambiguous, but T thuk chat *1n the middle of them”

Frankel also believes that fr. 12s the sole hasts for the account 1n Aetjus, and that Theophrastus

this ‘as good as certain’. Bur I agree with Vlastos who, in connexion with a different fragment,
spehs of Theaphrastus as having presumablya full text of the poem (T'4P4, 1946, 67, 1. 13).
Do Frankel and Salmsen mean, then, that the poem contained no mare about the ovépbven than 15

<p>       Cosmology: Parmenides, Plato and the Pythagoreans
 determines the limits of the stars. In this cosmic role she appears nearly
 a century later in the myth of Er in Plato’s Republic, where again we
 must imagine her seated in the centre of the universe, and her control
 of the movements of the heavenly bodies is symbolized by a spindle
 which she turns in her lap. The eight whorls of this spindle represent
 the courses of the fixed stars, sun, moon and planets. They vary in
 colour   and brightness         and    thus bear       a general      resemblance        to the
 circular bands of Parmenides, one inside the other, some fiery, some
 dark and some mixed. The descriptions of Plato and Parmenides are
 in a common tradition, and the only possible tradition is the Pythago-
 rean, The Pythagorean elements in the Platonic vision are well known.
 They include the musical ‘harmony’ or scale of notes produced by the
 varying distances and speeds of the planetary spheres, and the docirine
 of the cycle of lives.         Does this tradition throw further light on the
 nature and identity of the goddess?
 We have records of two Pythagorean cosmological systems, one
<p>  geocentric and one not. When Philolaus replaced the earth with a fire
  at the centre of the universe, making the earth into a planet, he called
  this central fire, among other names, ‘Mother of the gods’ and ‘ Hearth
  of the whole.” (In Greek Hestia, meaning hearth, was a goddess, for
  the hearth had strong religious associations.) That is, he had to transfer
  to the new cosmogonic centre the titles commonly given to the earth
  (‘cosmogonic’, since for a Pythagorean the living cosmos grew from the
<ol>
<li>centre, the central point being its ‘seed’, the warm source of life).
‘Earth the Mother,” wrote Euripides (fr. 944), ‘but the wise call thee
“Hestia, seated in the sky.” Hestia is again identified with the earth in
Plato’s Phaedrus (2472). The essential connexions of the name are
" central position (as in a Greek house) and life-giving warmth. Thosc
 . Pythagoreans who retained the geocentric scheme, and for whom
 therefore the central fire was a fire at the centre of the earth, described
 it as a creative power, a funcrion also aseribed by Empedocles to the
 hot centre of the earth:
 They speak of fire at the centre as the creative power which animates the
 whole earth from the centre and warms that part of it which has grown cold.<em>

 In view of all this, it looks as if Parmenides, in putting together a
cosmology which is to take account of extant views but improve upon
them, has chosen for his central directing goddess the divine, generative
fire in the centre, or the depths, of the earth. This, to his probably
Pythagorean-trained mind, was the daimon who was so widely wor-
shipped under the name of Earth herself, Mother of all life. In Hesiod
she gave birth not only to the mountains and the sea, but also to the
starry heaven. In Aeschylus, as here in Parmenides, she is ‘one form
with many names’, and his Prometheus calls her Themis, which brings
her close to the Justice of Parmenides. The association, between Earth
and Justice appears again in the Choephori. Like prophecy, the dis-
pensation of justice is within the province of most chthbnian powers.t
This supposition is in no way contradicted by the fact that for Par-
menides the elements Fire and Earth were contraries, opposed as the
active to the passive, It is not the cold and earthy element which is
divine and life-producing, but the element of fire in the earth, which
‘warms the cold part of it’. So in Empedocles all life arose out of the
earth, but only because “many fires burn heneath it’. Itis the fire which
‘sent them up’,?
 One or two details of the fragmentary account of the natural world
remain to be mentioned. Parmenides has been credited with ascribing
spherical shape to the earth, and though legitimate doubts have been
expressed, it is probable that he did. The evidence is in two sentences of
Diogenes. At 9.21 he says: ‘He was the first to declare that the earth
is spherical and is situated at the centre.’ In placing it at the centre =
he was anticipated by Anaximander and some of the Pythagoreans, if <em>

ing 10 the two words y¥ and x8dv. X8cv refers in origin to the cold, dead depths; the earthonly

 Hare is perhaps the answer to an objecrion which bas been made to the Aristotelian character-
ization of Parmewides's fire as the activating power, namely that in this capacity it would be
superfluous, since the activating power is the gaddess (ZN, y05). Fire is a manifestation of the
goddess's activity.
 The view that the dairmon of Parmenides corresponds to the central fire of the Pythagoreans,
though here thought out afresh, is not new. See, e.g., ZN, 717L In the note on p. 718 Nestle

 not more generally.            Anaximander’s argument that the earth remains
 at the centre without support on account of its ‘equilibrium’ is also
 attributed to him, as well as to Democritus (Aét. in 4 44). The second
 statement i3 at 8.48: “We are told that Pythagoras was the first to
 call. . .the earth round, though Theophrastus says it was Parmenides
 and Zeno that it was Hesiod.” The vagueness of this has aroused very
 natural suspicions, but at Jeast the attribution to Parmenides goes
 back through the Hellenistic age to Theophrastus, who resisted the
 tendency to give the credit for this discovery, as for many others, to
 Pythagoras.!
  Several discoveries are attributed by our sources to both Parmenides
<p> and Pythagoras, and it is likely that in describing the physical world
 he would follow his Pythagorean teachers on many points. Within
 the realm of becoming, his one all-important point of difference with
 them did not apply. Both are said to have perceived the identity of the
 Morning and Evening Stars (a fact which Greek astronomers must have
 learned very eatly from their Babylonian neighbours), and to have
 divided the earth into zones. The latter is more likely to have been the
 work of a later Pythagorean, if, as has been suggested in the previous
 volume (294), the sphericity of the earth was a later discovery.                             It must
 however be admitted that the evidence for these attributions is in-
 sufficient, and Posidonius had obtained from somewhere the informa-
 tion that the zoning of Parmenides was peculiar in that he made the
 torrid zone twice as broad as that berween the tropics, overflowing into
 the temperate zones (444a).
 He used the word ‘water-rooted’ of the earth,? not, presumably,

referring to the rivers of the underworld which are mentioned in the
Odyssey (10.513£.) and whose courses Plato describes in detail in the
myth of the Phaedo.          His alleged statements that the earth was made of
compacted air and the stars of compressed fire are reminiscent of Tonian
ideas, though whether he himself used their familiar word ‘felting’,
which appears in the doxography, cannot of course be known in the
absence of his own verses. The Milky Way is a mixture of dense
and rare (which is said to account for its colour), or alternatively a
‘breathing of fire’, and the sun and moon have been detached from
it, one from      the rare and hot part and the other fram                         the dense
and cold.<em>
The moon is described in two extant verses: (fr. 13) ‘A night-
<p>shining, foreign light wandering round the earth’ and (fr. 15) ‘Always
looking towards the rays of the sun’, In the first he puns on a phrase in
Homer, where a word similar to that used here for ‘light’ means ‘man’,
the whole phrase simply meaning ‘a foreigner’.? These lines are prob-
ably the authority for the statement that Parmenides recognized that the
moon was illuminated by the sun. Fr. 14, however, does not imply
this. Fr. 15 mighr be thought 10 do so, and the doxography as re-
presented by Agtius gives him credit for the assertion. However, our
faith in this is weakened when the same authority elsewhere declares
that Thales first made the discovery, and that Pythagoras, Parmenides,
Empedocles, Anaxagoras and Metrodorus followed him; and against
it we have the more impressive authority of Plato, who in the Crazylus
cleatly gives the credit to Anaxagoras. It might be thought to receive
some support from the assertion thar Parmenides derived the sun from
the hot, and the moon from the cold and dense part of the Milky Way,
were it not that the same anthority in another place says that he called
the moon fiery. There is unfortunately no check on the accuracy of
these incautious statements.3

<p>Theophr. De sensu, 1fl. (446): </p>
</em> The majority of beliefs about sensation,
and the most widely held, fall into two classes. Some effect it by similarity,
others by the contrary, by similarity Parmenides, Empedocles and Plato,
and by the contrary Anaxagoras and Heraclitus. Parmenides gives no general
explanation, but only says that there are two elements and knowledge cor-
responds to the preponderant one. Thought varies according 1o whether the
hot or the cold prevails, but that which is due to the hot is better and purer,
though even then it requires a certain balance. <em>“For”,he writes (fr. 16),
“as is at any moment the mixture of the straying limbs, so is the mind in
men ; for what thinks is the same for each and every man, the substance of the
limbs. What preponderates is thought.” He speaks of sensarion and thonght as
the same. Hence memory and forgetfulness too ate due to these two elements
through their mixture. But whether or not it will be possible to think, and
 what will be the arrangement, if they are equal in the mixwre, he does not go on
 10 explain. Nevertheless that he does attrihute sensation to the opposite itself
 is clear from his statement that a corpse has no awareness of light and heat
 and sound because the fire has deserted it, but does perceive their contraries
 like cold and silence. In general, everything that exists has some awareness.’
 The translation of fr. 16 follows the text in Theophrastus, except that i his be&amp;oroT" for Aristotle’s

<p>                                        The Eleatics
The quotation from Parmenides, in conjunction with the account of
<p>Theophrastus, gives a fairly intelligible theory of sensation and know~
ledge, even though much of the detail is omitted.” In emphasizing the
mutability and inconstancy of human perceptions he is following earlier
poetic tradition, with echoes of Homer and Archilochus,<em>                             Perception
and understanding have entirely physical causes, and their clarity or
otherwise depends on the condition of the body. Preponderance of
fire or light in the perceiving subject brings about better and clearer
perception, and since like is known by like, this means the perception
of morelightand less darkness. So far the statement bears out Aristotle’s
impression that there is an analogy between fire or Iigh‘gt in the Way of
Seeming and truth or being in the real world.         3
However, it must not be forgotten that all this takes place in the
<p>deceitful world of seeming,
Tt would be wrong to jump to the conclusion that this preponderance pro-
vides also the physical formula for the knowledge of Being.                             No such
formula could be given without translating Being into terms of Becoming,.
 . The mortal frame, gua mortal, cannot think Being. Yet the ‘knowing
man’ can and does think it....To resolve the paradox is impossible, for it
is only the epistemological counterpart of the ontological dualism of Being
and Becoming.3

realm of light. </em> Translated into physical terms,” he continues, ‘this can only mean that though
the quest for truth begins with 2 mere pxepondemnce of light, it can only be completed in 2 state
of mind which is free from any darkness whatever.” T cannot atrach any meaning to the phrase
“translated into physical terms” as applied to the prologue, forit slready speaks ta physical terms.
What Professor Viastos ssems to want to do is to translate the knowledge of Being, as expressed in
the Way of Truth, into physical terms; and if we do that, we are false to the essence of Parmen-
ides’s teaching,

every contemporary natural philosopher would                     regard it), what is
described is in the eyes of Parmenides a deceitful counterpart of the
wruth which imposes itself on mortal minds. The relationship between
this counterfeit world and Being will be further considered in the next
section,
Considered on its merits as a physical theory (and there can be no
<p>doubt that Parmenides intended it to be taken seriously on its own
level), the account offers as a point of interest the attribution of some
measure of perception even to corpses,                  It is probable however that
most thinkers of the time believed that sensation and thought were a
matter of degree, and were present in rudimentary forms in all natural
substances. This was inherent in the early hylozoistic outlaok (vol. 1,
142£.), and with the statement that according to Parmenides ‘every-
thing that exists has some awareness’ we may compare Empedocles, a
practically contemporary philosopher also in the Italian tradition, who
wrote that ‘everything has thought and its due portion of insight’
(fr. 110.10). The sensitivity of corpses is however extremely limited,
because the warmzh of life has left them. The idea may have arisen from
a Pythagorean background, for, as we read in the Pythagorean com-
mentaries excerpted by Alexander,® ‘all things live which partake of
heat (hence plants also are living things), but not all have soul, which
is a detached part of airher, both hot and cold’. Heat is the condition
of life, and, because of the preponderance of heat in him, man is related
to the gods, which is the reason why they take care of him.
On the nature of the soul (psyche) there are only a few scraps of
<p>indirect information, not altogether consistent. It is said to be fiery,
as one would expect, but also to be made of fire and earth, and located
in the breast. This ought perhaps to be taken with the statement that
Parmenides, Empedocles and Democritus identified mind and psyche,
and according to them no living creature is uttetly without reason.?
That men and animals as a whole are compounded of fire and earth,
with fire as the lively and cognitive part, was an old and widespread
belief. In Hesiod the first woman was created out of mud by the god

fashioned men out of a mixture of earth and fire. The Prometheus-
story points in the same direction, replacing the notion of life-giving
fire in the bosom            of Mother        Earth herself, which was given a more
philosophical expression by Empedocles. Since the purely fiery part
is reason, and every living creature possesses some quota of warmzh,
rationality may have been thought to be only a question of degree.
 Then when philosophers attempted to rationalize the acbzizpted beliefs,
and could still only do so on the material plane, it would be natural that

<p>some of them should treat the living body as a nnity ofi mingled fire
and earth rather than divide it into two separate entitiés, bady and
soul. This however, so far as concerns Parmenides, must remain specu~
lative, for it would be unwise to rely too much on the casual utterance
of a writer like Macrobius.
 Simplicius says of the goddess mentioned in frr. 1z and 13 that she
<p>‘sends souls now from the visible to the unseen, and again the other
way’. This has sometimes been taken to refer to a doctrine of im-
mortality and palingenesis: there is an upper, aetherial realm, and the
unseen is the earth; birth is a descent and death the return to a lugher
life.” Once again we are dealing with a tiny and ambiguous scrap of
evidence, bur more probably the reference is to the goddess’s pawer
over ordinary birth (mentioped in fr. 12) and death. At one time she is
assisting life out of the invisibility of nonentity (or perhaps the dark~
ness of the womb, either of a human mother or of the earth whence all
life originated), and later she sends the soul down to Hades, whose
name itself means ‘the unseen’.?
* Simpl, Phys. 39.18, quoted by DK with {r. 13,        Gigon, for instance (Ursprung, 281), rans+
<p>lates 76 éupawés as ‘light’, and sees here the standard Parmenidean opposition of Light and
Darkness, The earth is made of Darkness, therefore <em>the Light’ is a supra-terrestrial realm. He
then connects Simplicius’s starement with that of D.L. 9. 22 thac ‘men weve ficst born from chesun’,
where several schofars have thought it right o emend #iov (sun) 10 vos (mud). The origin of
men from the sun thus becomes a modification (einz offensichiliche Umgestoltung) of the Pytha-
gorean belief that the abode of souls (s in the stars. There is nothing inherently improbable in
supposing that Parmenides followed Pythagorean religious beliefs in the Way of Seeming,          but the
 translation of &amp;upovés as ‘light” is dubious, and st is impossible that in the writings of a Platonist
like Sunplicius T4 dugavis should stand for the heavenly tealm. For any Placanist, 0 tugavés is

                                (11) Being and sceming
<p>_One view of the Way of Seeming! is that it is ‘wholly dialectical’ in
“intent. That is to say, Parmenides wishes to provide his reader with
 the best possible account of the world as it appears to mortals, not
 because that account is in any way nearer ta reality than others: the
 arguments of the Way of Truth have proved it to be totally unreal.
 His motive, expressed in the words ‘ that no judgment of mortals may
 outstrip thee’, is only that no one may be able to produce a more
 plausible description and explanation of the natural world which might
 shake belief in its unreality. For this purpose nothing but the best
 would do, and in fact even his own story, which he took great pains
 to make as persuasive as possible and yet had already proved to be
 false, did not succeed in its aim: on the whole, men continued 1o believe
  that phenomena had some reality at least.
 According to this argument,                   Parmenides         wrote a cosmology              as
<p> convincing and watertight as he could in order to make people accept
 his proof that it was non-existent. But if a man wishes not simply to
 assign to cosmology its proper subordinate place, but 10 destroy irs
 whole foundation, it seems an unlikely and unwise procedure to con-
 struct the most persuasive account possible—even if he has argued
 beforehand that it is based on false logic.* Accordingly a different
 approach will be made here.
 In anacking the problem of the relation between truth and opinion,
<p> being and seeming (on which something has been said already), one is
 immediately struck by certain correspondences between names and

Parmenides wanted to put an end to cosmology and so strove to show that it rested on false

 of mathematics is close enough for the purpose.’ To my mind, this fundamental difference of
 aim cenders the comparison useless.</li>

intentional.   In the Way of Seeming everything starts from the two
primary opposites Fire (or Light) and Night.          In the prologue the
poet’s journey is from the house of Night to the Light, guided by the
Sun-maidens: an obvious allegory of the progress from ignarance to
knowledge or from falsehood to truth. This lends support to the
Aristotelian view that within the Way of Seeming Light was in some
way closer to Being than Night. Further support has just been found
in Theophrastus’s account of the theory of knowledgejin the Way of
Seeming. Preponderance of fire in the bodily comp(gsition leads to
‘better and purer’ knowledge. Since like is known by like, nearer
apprehension of reality must be attained when there is solnething closer
to reality in the thinking subject. Fire is the nearest to Being in the
phenomenal world, hence its predominance brings the morta] mind as
close as itcan come, without divine revelation,to the perception of Being.
Correspondences also occur in the mention of deities. Justice appears
<p>in all three parts. In the prologue she is keyholder of the gates of the
ways of Night and Day, and she and her cognate Themis, so Par-
menides is assured, have sponsored his journey through them. In the
Way of Truth she sees 1o it that there is no becoming or perishing of
what is, and in the Way of Seeming Justice is one of the names of the
goddess who ‘ directs all things’. In view of this, one may suppose that
her command of the passage between Night and Day in the prologue
is linked with her control over the admixture of Night and Light in the
Way of Seeming,
Ananke (Necessity) is another name for the all-directing goddess.
<p>As such she fatters the heaven to hold the peirara of the stars. In the
Way of Truth Fate festered <em>what is’ to be whole and unmoved, and
Justice had fetters with which she prevented ‘what is’ from suffering
birth or decay. In the same section mighty Ananke herself keeps ‘ what
is” in the bonds of a peiras. Because Being has a final peiras it is said to
be spherical: in the Way of Seeming the peirata of the stars are held by
the spherical heaven which goes round the world, encompassing all
the circular bands. Others too believed the universe to be spherical, L
but for Parmenides its spherical shape must have had special significance,
when the only way that he could describe the realm of intelligible
Being was by comparing it to ‘the mass of a well-rounded ball’.

<p>          Relation berween Being and Seeming in Parmenides
 The interlocking of the language is done with deliberate care. To
<p> cite another example, the subject-matter of truth is distinguished from
 that of seeming as being from becoming, The true function of Ananke
 is 10 sustain the being of ‘what is” . This simply means (since divine
 agency has only metaphorical application to the one Being) that Being
 necessarily is: changeless, timeless, indivisible etc. But as it falsely
 seems to mortals, she maintains Becoming, and her power to do this
 appears as the power of fire, warmth or light, which are therefore part
 of her nature. Becoming is in the apparent world the counterfeit of
 Being in the real.         [f (per impossibile) becoming should cease, and the
 perceptible cosmos turn dead and cold, its motionlessness would not
 be that of Being but at the opposite pole. 1t would resemble the state
 of corpses, which </p>

</em>through lack of fire have no feeling of light, heat

<li>or sound but only of their contraries like cold and silence’. Fire, then,

warld to Being in the real. This analogy of Fire with Being seems to
be emphasized in a deliberate echo when one compares the language
describing the self-idenrity of Being in 8.29, ‘the same in the same
place it remains by itself”, with that applied to Fire in 8. 57, ‘in every
" direction the same as itself’.?
What are we to make of all this? First, it is no detraction from the
<ul>
<li>extraordinary consistency of Parmenides’s thought to say that one can-
 not read his poem without feeling that he is constantly struggling
" against the sheer inadequacy of the available Janguage. Simplicius the
 Neoplatonist says that he calls the second part of his poem deceptive
 <em> </em>not as being false in an absolute sense’, and although this is probably
 " wrong, it is worth remembering that if Parmenides had wanted to say
'it, it would have been beyond his power to do so. When he wrote:
" *The verdict lies here: is it or is it not?’, he was to a great extent the</li>
<li>prisoner of language. Anyone asked that now would reply, ‘In what
sense are you using the verb “to be”? In the sense of existing, or
being this or that, or what?’ Such questions were not admissible for
Parmenides. Not only did the word have only one sense for him, but he
¥ 1do not agree that the simple phrase ke’ avrzé, applied to Night, is necessarily the equivalent
of this description of Fire (Mansfeld, Offenbarung, 133fL.). It only emphasizes the separateness
of the two opposites, and need noc canflice with Axistotle’s assessment of their respective analogies
to &amp;v and piy 6v.</li>

<p>                                 The Eleatics
considered all others guilty of illogicality for not having recognized
this truth.
 Next, in assessing Parmenides, it is impossible to avoid comparison
<p>with Plato, who in spite of his greater manuity of thoughr and ex-
pression based himself firmly on the logic of his Eleatic predecessor.
In a passage from the Timaeus already quoted he draws as sharply as
Parmenides ever did the distinction between being and becommg, what
can be thought about and what only seems.
The first distinction to be made is this: what is it that alw:;ys is, and never
becomes; and what hecomes everlastingly but never is?{ The one com-
prehensible by intellection with reasoned argument, being always consistent,
the other believed by opinjon     with unreasoning     sensation, coming   into
being and perishing but never truly being (27d-284a).
Again in the Republic (477b):
Then opinion and knowledge are directed towards different objecss, each
according to its own function.
  Yes,
  And the natural object of knowledge is what is.</p>
</p>
<p>A little later, when he is comparing the relation of the eye to sunlight
with that of the mind to truth, his language becomes strikingly
Parmenidean (508d):
‘When the soul comes to rest on an object ifluminated by truth and Being, it
understands and knows and appears to have nous; but when it regards what
is mixed with darkness, that is, what comes to be and perishes, it has only
opinion and its sight is dimmed: its beliefs shift up and down and it is like .
something without nous.
Here we have the equation of truth and being with light and the state- -
ment that what becomes and perishes is mixed with darkness. Opinion
is dim-sighted and shifts up and down, as in Parmenides the mortals *
who rely on opinion are blind, and are borne along on a path that turns
back on itself; and only ‘what is” can be the object of nous.          :
Plato’s solution was to abandon the exclusive antithesis between
<p>what is and what is not, and 1o classify the sensible world as a third
ontological category, ‘ wallowing between not-being and pure being’
(Rep.    479d).   Cogpnition   is correspondingly     threefold:   opinion or
                                   74
<p>                        Phenomena as a Hallucination
belief is a mental state between knowledge and jgnorance. Knowledge,
which to deserve the name must be certain and permanent, can only
have changeless Being as its object: the absolutely non-existent can
obviously not be known at all: concerning the world of appearances,
of which our senses make us aware as a congeries of changing, appeas-
ing and disappearing objects, we hold beliefs or opinions as changeable
as the objects themselves. In the Sophist such arguments are directed
against Parmenides by name:
In self-defence we must question the argument of our father Parmenides and
force the conclusion that what is not, in some                 respect is, and conversely
that what is, in a way is not (241 d).</p>
</p>
</p>
For Parmenides there was no third way. To suppose a category
<p>‘between what is and what is not’ was expressly contrary to the
divinely revealed Jogos. What follows is false. But it is, as the word
<em>seeming’ suggests, a phantom or image of reality (Plato would call
it an eikon),® and of that phantom some aspects bear more resemblance
1o reality than others. If there were no resemblance, it is difficult to
see how it could ‘deceive’. This is not to weaken Parmenides’s logic
by introducing any degrees of reality. The phenomenal world is of the
nature of a hallucination or dream. Everything in a dream is equally
unreal, but anyone who has dreamed knows that some dream-elements
are more life reality than others.                  One   day we say: ‘Last night I
dreamed abour the house I lived in as a boy. It was extraordinarily
vivid, and every detail was just as it used to be.” Another time: ‘1
dreamed about the house I lived in as a boy.                      At least that is what it
was in my dream, though I see now that it wasn’t very like it.” The
conclusion commonly drawn from the goddess’s words at 8. 5off., that
there is no relation or resemblance between Being and its counterfeit,
'is wrong, and it is not un-Parmenidean to say that some parts of the
 latter remind one of Being more than others.
’ What Parmenides has not succeeded in establishing is any logical
 refationship between the truth and its counterfeit, or any logical
 status for the world of seeming. If it ‘is not’, why do we imagine it

and what is the difference between illusion and blank nothingness?
That is precisely the problem which he bequeathed to Plato, and which
Plato thought he had solved by substituting a trichotomy—being, non-
being,    and    becoming:         knowledge,         ignorance,       and    belief—for        the
Eleatic dichotomy.<em> As for Parmenides, we can only end as we began,
with a reminder of the deeply religious and mystical character of the
prologue. He is mortal like others, living in the world of seeming, but
by divine favour he has been granted knowledge of true Being. His
journey in the sun-chariot from darkness to light was more than a
series of steps in deductive reasoning, though it was that as well.                               Tt
afforded a glimpse of the eternal, a release from the bongiage of earthly
existence. Such release, such ekstasis, had been attainéd by psycho-
logically gifted seers before him, but to transform this recognized
religious experience into a philosophical revolution was the achieve-
ment of none but Parmenides.? The attributes of Being, as revealed by
the goddess, follow a strict deductive order. In his spiritual preparation
for this unique experience he owed much to the Pythagoreans, for they
00 had combined mystical religion with the recognition of intelligible,
mathematical truth; but their insight fell short of revealing the im-
passable logical gulf separating that world of timeless truth from the
shifring panorama of physical objects and events. It is hardly a criticism
of Parmenides to say that in the very moment of a discovery which
changed the whole face of philosophy there was not also revealed to
him a means of accounting for the false semblance of reality exhibited
to mortals by the wotld of appearances, nor of bringing the two worlds’
into any logical relationship again without contravening the new and
austere canons of thought which he himself had just laid down. His
permanent contribution to thought was to assert that what is, is, and
can be thought about, and what is not, is not, and cannor be thought
about; and to state and abide by the consequences of those assertions.
 
</em> Of Reinhardt's Parmenides von Fritz writes (CP, 1943, 237) that he has ‘shown conclusively
that the second part is neither a description of the actual beliefs and opinions of the “ two-headed
mortals™, . .nor an artempt to give a better system of the world of mere belief than most peaple
have, but that it is fundamentally an attempt to show how there can be a world of belief side by side
with truth and Aow it originates” (my italics)., But thisis just what Parmenides did not do, nor,
so far as I can see, could he even attempt it on the premises which he adopts and sticks to so
consistently and courageously,

                          The Opposites in Parmenides
<p>As has been pointed out on p. 58, the qualities associated with Fire and
Night respectively form a systoichia on the lines of the Pythagorean
one, except that it is confined 1o sensible properties. It is tempting
therefore to try to reconstruct such a parallel table, bearing in mind that
it is intended by Parmenides as a rationalization of existing beliefs.
Analogy with the general tenour of Greek thought would suggest the
following:*
                           Active                        Passive

                          right                          left
                           male                          female
                           soft                          hard
</p>
<p>This conjectural table corresponds, where they overlap, to the Py-
thagorean, in which brightness, right and male are together opposed
to darkness, left and female.               It agrees with corrent Greek ideas in
ranging dense, cold and heavy on the passive side and rare, hot and
light on the active, for this suits any account which, ltke Anaximander’s
 * Dry and moist are not in our authorities but can hardly have been nussing. I have placed
<p>soft and hard 2ccarding to the note found by Simplicius in his copy of the poem, but in view of
the statement in A37 char Parmemdes believed the outermast shell of the cosmas to be hard and
solid, with fire immediately belowit, I feel some doubt about this. The pair occupied an ambiguous
positionamang   the oppositesin Greek thought, owing to the varied effects of heat, which on the one
hand dries out moisture, and on the other hand liquefies hard substances. Thus De viceu (ch, 9)
describes the hard parts of the body, like bone, as formed by the agency of fire in solidifying by
driving out the water,   On the otler side is the common association of heat with the abundant
blood, moisture and pliancy (ypéms) of youthfil bodies, and cold with the dryness and brittle-
ness of age. (See also pp. 1881 below.)</p>

or the myths, derives life from the moist and solid earth when acted
upon by the hotter, rarer element fire, The alignment of the opposites
is most clearly seen in Hippolytus’s account of Anaxagoras (A 42):
The dense, moist, dark and cold, and all heavy bodies came together to the
centre, solidified, and formed the earth; but the opposites of these, the Ao,
the bright, the dry and the fight projected themselves to the further parts of
the aither.
Above all, the columns as here given would agree                           yith all Greek
<p>thought in assigning the superior and active power to thé male element,
the mfenor and passive role to the female. Here howeyer comes lhe
problem, for this is just what Parmenides does not appl:ar to do. H
does indeed (and for this we have his own words) associate male Wlth
right and female with left hand (fr. 17), thus far confirming the expecta-
tion that he could not have been so un-Greek as to have given the
superior place to the female. But our informants say that in his physio-
logy men are preponderantly cold and dense, women preponderantly
warm and rare. The testimonies are these.
Arist. De part. an. 648225 (A§2): ‘Some say fish are warmer than land-
<p>creatures, so that their natural hear counterbalances the cold of their environ~
ment, and bloodless animals warmer than those with blood, and females than
males; e.g. Parmenides and certain others say that women                     are hotter than
men, arguing that the menstrual Aow is due to the heat and the abundance
of blood.    Empedocles however says the opposite.”
At 5.7.1-2 (DK, 31481 and 28453). ‘According to Empedocles
<p>distinction of sex depends on heat and cold, wherefore he says that when ™
living creatures arose out of the earth, the first males appeared in the south
and east, and the females in the northerly parts. Parmenides says the con-
trary: those in the north were males (for the male partakes more of density), |
and those in the south females in accordance with their rarefied texmre.’
1t seems unlikely that these sources are mistaken, especially as they
<p>take the trouble to point out that Empedocles took a contrary view.!
Aristotle also adds the circumstantial detail about the meases, though
* This would raise another small puzzle 1f we were to trust Censorinus (Emped. A81) when        .
<p>he says that Empedocles, like Parmenides, supposed male and female embryos to be engendered
in the right- and left-hand sides of the womb respectively; for it would then be even more
steange that the twa should be at adds aver the relation of male and female o heat and cold. But
Aristotle appears to distinguish Empedocles from those who connect difference of sex with
position in the womb (G4, 765a4).</p>

<p>            Appendix: The Opposites in Parmenides
it is just possible that this might come from the ‘certain others” and not
from Parmenides. Yet this evidence makes it very difficult to construct
a consistent list of opposites for Parmenides. If it is to contain the pair
male and female at all, it seems we must put male on the negative side
of ‘invisible Night’, and female on the side of Fire. But if we do this,
then fr. 17 compels us to put right hand also with Night and left hand
with Fire, contrary to the Pythagorean (and, one would have thought,
any other Greek) scheme.
Probably male and female were not pure opposites in his system,
<p>but ‘mixcures of them’, as Aristotle says air and water were (Gen. et
corr. 330b 14). There is a suggestion of this in the use of the comparative
by Aétius. But it is difficult to believe in any explanation by a Greek
which makes the male colder and denser-—and so presumably darker,
heavier and generally more passive and negative—than the female.
Nor does it suit the statement of Parmenides himself that meles are
formed on the right-hand side and females on the left. Right belongs
in the same column as brightness or fire, the column of superior
qualities. That is where the Pythagoreans put it, along with goodness,
so that, as Simplicius sad (De caels 186.20): * They called nghs good
and left bad.”
The   truth may   be that whereas      in cosmology    broad   schematic
<p>accounts were still the rule, with primary opposites playing traditional
roles, in a subject like embryology a considerable amount of elementary
‘observation was taking place, and a more empirical outlook allowed
for greater variety of opinion about the role of the opposites. De viczu
 (ch. 34, v1, 512 Litteé) subscribes to the common view that in general
 males are hotter and drier than females (though this varies also with
_age, ch. 33), but attributes this not 1o any original genetic principle but
 (a) to the way of life led by each, and (5) to the ‘ purgation of the hot’
 undergone monthly by females. Here we see an author drawing from
 the same phenomenon (the menses) a conclusion opposite to that which
 Aristotle ascribes to Parmenides. In the same passage Aristotle records
 the belief of some that fish are warmer than land-creatures because they
 need more natural heat to counteract the cold of their environment. It
 is easy to see here also that a contrary conclusion could, and commonly
 would, be drawn from the same observations.

  Again, the cosmologists, as we have noted, regularly associated
<p>thick with cold and rare with heat; but at least for Aristotle, when it
came to physiology it was possible to equate thick and hot. There is,
he says (Gen. an. 76523414%), something to be said for connecting
distinction of sex with hot and cold, right and left; for the right-hand
parts of the body are hotter than the left, and concocted sperm is
hotter, and also thickened (cuvestés); and it is thickened sperm that bas
the higher generative power (s¢. and is therefore capa}ble of producing
the superior male sex).</p>

                                       B.   ZENO
                                  (1) Date and life
<p>Zeno of Elea, a pupil of Parmenides, defended his master’s paradoxical
thesis by the device, not of arguing directly in its favour, but of show-
ing up its contrary as absurd. In the course of this exposition of the
contradictions which, as it seemed to him, were inherent in the notions
of plurality and motion, he produced a series of arguments on which
logicians and mathematicians have sharpened their wits from his day
to   our   own.</p>
  Plato, in a passage already quoted in connexion with Parmenides
<p>(p- 1 above), says that he was some twenty-five years younger than his
teacher, Probably therefore he was born about 490. Apollodorus put
his floruit at 464-1, following his own mechanical procedure of making
the disciple forty years younger than the master. Others mention the
Olympiads of 468-5 and 456—3. The differences are not great, and the
safest course is to follow Plato.?
Little is known of his life. He is said to have been a particularly
<p>loyal citizen of his native Elea, ‘preferring it to the arrogance of
Athens’, whither he refused to migrate.? Presumably therefore he
spent most of his life in S. Italy, though a sojourn in Athens is attested
not only by Plato but by a remark in Plutarch’s Life of Pericles (ch. 43
and cf. 5) that Pericles heard Jectures by him. The Platonic Alcibindes

also says (Ale. I, 1194) that Callias son of Calliades was taught by Zeno
for a fee of 100 minae, and this can hardly have taken place elsewhere
than in Athens. Stories were current in latet antiquity of his resistance
to a tyrant and heroic behaviour under torture, but both the name of
the tyrant and the details of the story vary.</p>
                            (2) Writings and method
<p>Zeno wrote in prose.           Plato speaks as if he were known for one work
only, and Simplicius employs similar terms. The Suda appears to men-
tion four: Disputations, Against the philosophers, On nature (if these
two are not one title), and an examination of the work of Empedocles.
The first three could easily have been names given in Alexandrian rimes
to a single work, and it is rather dubious whether Zeno could have
written a work on Empedocles, which is only attributed to him by this
one late source.t One of the logical puzzles, the ‘millet seed’, is given
by Simplicius in the form of a question put by Zeno to the Sophist
Protagoras. He must therefore have known it either simply as an
anecdote or from a dialogue in which Zeno and Protagoras were
speakers.      However,       none     of the surviving           guotations      from     Zeno
sounds as if he wrote dialogues himself, and it is unlikely that any-
one before Aristotle should have put himself into a dialogue. The
story as Simplicius gives it cannot come directly from his work, though
it may of course have been based on something in it.? Most of our
knowledge of the contents of the work comes from Aristotle and his
Neoplatonic commentators. To the latter we owe a nember of direct
quotations, but on the question whether they still possessed the entire
treatise opinions have varied considerably.3
  <em> Zeller (ZN, 745 n.) thought iz impassible that the baok on Empedocles should be genuine,
but his reasons are not compelling, Gaye (J. Phil. 1908, 114) supposes Empedocles to have been
a somewhat older contemporary of Zeno, and concludes that the work was polemic. His
suggestion that the fourth of the extant arguments against motion is directed particnlarly against
Empedocles is highly conjectural,
  Lee (Z. of E. 8) thinks the title wpbs Tobs pihoospous may be genuine, and provides soma
evidence that Zeno regarded the Pythagoreans as fus chief opponents.      Cf. vol. 1, 204; Burnet,
£GP, 312 (but also ZN, 438). Heidel on the other hand (4JP, 1940, 22) thovght it “most im-
probable” that the title was Zeno’s, </em> if we date the work about 465°. He does nat say why.
* Cf. Burnet, £GP, 311; Lee, Z. of E. 11a; Alfieri, Aromos Idea, 42, n. 1. The argument itself

<p>                                            The Eleatics
Zeno’s treatise was divided into several arguments (Jogor), each con-
<p>taining a number of Aypotheses. These were so called because they
opened with a conditional sentence, the object being to show that en
this kypothesis impossible and contradictory conclusions are in-
escapable.! In Plato’s Parmenides, for instance, Socrates quotes the
first Aypothests of the first logos as follows: If existing things are many,
they must be like and unlike.’
 In all probability he confined himself to this dialectical refutation of
<p>Parmenides’s opponents, and did not bother his Head about any
description of the illusory world of nature corresponding to the second
part of Parmenides’s poem.                  One or two late soutces rei fer 1o him some
vague statements about the cosmos and man, but these ate of no interest
and probably wrongly attributed.?
The method adopted by Zeno was something new, as Aristotle
<p>recognized when he called him the inventor, or pioneer, of dialectic.3
By ‘dialectic’ Aristotle meant a definite technique, to which he
devates a whole              treatise, the Topics.          It is the art of arguing, not
from premises that are necessary, self-evident or previously demon-
strated (which are all that a philosopher may usein his search for positive
truth), but from beliefs commonly accepted or accepted by other
thinkers, with the object of exposing them if they are false or in-
text in hand’. Two years later Friakel, writing in the same periodical, remarked that oone of
the commentatars seems to have used Zeno's book ae first haad for his expasition of the argument,
Taylor pronounced it uncertain whether they did or not. Lee thinks that at Phys. 140.27
Simplicius ‘definitely claims 1o have had access to an onginal work of Zeno’, although he quotes
only from the arguments against plurality and not {rom those against motion. The inference from
his words is not certain, From Phys. 138-9 Zeller concluded that although Alexander and
Porphyry did not have the complete work, Simplicius himself must have had it because he de-
scribes   its contents in detail   as well as quoting 2 passage.   He adnuts however   thar 99.17£. is
evidence that Simplicius himself had doubts about the completeness of his own copy, and surely
its incompleteness is confirmed on p. 140, where he conjectures that an argument attnibuted by
Porphyry to Parmenides should m fact be credited to Zeno <em>There is nothing Like it in the
Parmenidean writings,” he says, ‘and mast of our infarmadon refers the dilemma based on
dichotomy to Zeno." However, we may say with confidence that he had ar the least a com-
prehensive series of verbaum extracts dealing with the arguments against plurahty.

</em> For Plato’s Ywoléomis Simplicius uses the word émyeprisara. Proclus (DK, axg) said that
there were 40 Jogoi in all, but his informanon is naconfirmed and probably second-hand.

adequate (Top. 1.1). In the Rhetoric (13552 29~36) he says that only
rhetoric and dialectic draw contrary conclusions from identical premises,
not ta make people believe both, but in order to lay bare the real state
of affairs and find the way out when someone is arguing unfairly. Thus
Zeno, to take one example, argued from the premise ‘there are many
existing things’ that these things must be both finite and infinite in
number, his object being to make plain the truth (discovered by
Parmenides) that reality is a unity. This extraction of contradictories is
also referred to by Plato, who in the Phaedrus (261d) calls him the
Eleatic Palamedes, who can make the same things appear like and un-
like, one and many, at rest and in motion. (The hero Palamedes was
renowned for cunning and inventiveness.)*</p>
                      (3) History of incerprecation
<p>Most of the arguments of Zeno of which we have knowledge may be
divided into two sets, directed respectively against the ideas of plurality
and motion. In addition there is one brief argument raising a difficulty
about the existence of place, and finally the ‘millet seed” (‘If a single
grain makes no sound in falling, how can a bushel make a sound?’),
whose pedigree we have seen to be not above suspicion. It would seem
obvious therefore that he is, as Plato said, a faithful disciple of Par-
menides, who had taught him that reality was one, indivisible and
motionless, and empty space non-existent and unthinkable.
This was the accepted opinion until, in the latter part of the nine-
<p>teenth century,    the Frenchman        Paul T: annery put forward            the view
that Zeno had no wish to deny the possibility of motion, but only to
affiem its incompatibility with a belief in plurality. Aristotle (who is
practically our sole source for this set of arguments) misunderstood
him and underestimated the subtlety of his thought.                    His real aim was
to refute a Pythagorean thesis thar solid bodies, surfaces and lines are
pluralities, i.e. pluralities of points, considered as infinitesimal magni-
tudes. Tannery was followed by V. Brochard and G. No#l, and this
French interpretation (represented also by Bayle and Milhaud) made a
great impression, especially on philosophers and mathematicians, who
               * On Zeno and dialecuc see also Lee, Z, of £, 1136
                                       83                                     62
<p>                                    The Eleatics
now began to see in Zeno an intellectual giant who had changed the
face of mathematics and logic. This estimate of him was given most
striking expression by the Germans H. Hasse and H. Scholz, and
notably upheld in England by Lord Russell, who characterized the four
arguments on motion as ‘immeasurably subtle and profound’.t
 The point of view attributed to Zeno by Tannery was certainly an
<p>astonishing one for a follower of Parmenides. Van der Waerden (op.
ciz. below, 143) has pointed out that it credits him with the following
train of thought: ‘On the hypothesis of plurality motion i% impossible.
Since however motion evidently can occur, plurality must,be rejected.”
Zeller never accepted Tannery’s view, and a vigorous reaction against
it was started by the Iralian G. Calogero in 1932, and Yiven fresh
impetus by van der Waerden in 1940. These scholars insisted that any
interpretation of Zeno must start from his Eleatic background (which
is assured by Plato), and denied that ourinformation yieldsany evidence
of a polemic against infinitesimals or against the Pythagoreans.
In England       Cornford,      and after him        Sir Desmond         Lee, while
<p>seeing Zeno as primarily an upholder of the Eleatic thesis of the unity
of being, endorsed Tannery’s opinion so far as to argue that the critics
of Parmenides whom he set out to refute were the Pythagoreans.
Cornford in particular developed his theory of Pythagorean ‘number-
atomism’ as the target of Zeno’s attacks. Raven, while critical of the
‘number-atomism’         hypothesis,      had    no    wish    to   deny    their    anti-
Pythagorean purport, though he thought them couched in terms which
could apply to other pluralist theories too. The difficulty felt by Lee,
and clearly expressed by A. E. Taylor, in supposing Zeno to be attack-
ing only the general assumptions of plurality and motion common to
all mankind, is this: he is admittedly arguing from his opponents’
premises, yet the premises he takes are much too specific, e.g. that
magnitudes are infinitely divisible and at the same time made up of
(indivisible) elements. To make sense of these arguments’, concludes
Lee, ‘we must suppose them to have been directed against a system in
which certain definite confusions were made.’

<p>                     History of the Interpretation of Zeno
  Zeno's logoi implies no more than that he started from the simple
  premises ‘there is plurality” and ‘there is motion’, both of which are
  asserted not only by the ordinary man but by all opponents of Eleati-
  cism. This is the line recently taken, against Cornford and Lee, by
  N. B. Booth in a vigorous development of the views of Calogero and
  van der Waerden. In particular he deprecates as anachronistic the
  modern tendency to accuse Aristotle of failing to understand Zeno on
  the ground that Zeno could not have made the elementary Jogical
  blunders of which Aristotle supposes him guilty, Zeno’s arguments,
  he thinks, may have been provoked partly by the Pythagoreans, but
  they are directed against the whole idea of motion, plurality and place,
  not against specifically Pythagorean theories of them. This was also
  the opinion of W. A. Heidel, who cited the temark of Philoponus that
 those who speak of plarality rely on its self-evidence: there are hosses,
  men and other creatures and objects. This, he says, is common sense,
  not philosophy, nor are the Pythagoreans likely to have indulged in
  the kind of ridicule of Parmenides of which Plato makes Zeno speak.!
  About the same time as Booth, G. E. L. Owen also came out strongly
  for the view that the anti-Pythagorean interpretation is a myth. There
  is, he considers, inadequate evidence for the state of Pythagorean
  mathematics in Zeno’s time, and if it was what it is usually supposed to
  be, Zeno’s arguments would not be directed primarily at it.</p>

                              (4) General purpose
<p>The general nature and purpose of Zeno’s arguments are clearly stased
by Plato. When all allowance is made for the conventional freedoms of
dialogue, he remains a source too close to the original to be ignored.
Whether or not the discussion between Parmenides, Zeno and Socrates
is historical, Zeno came to Athens during the manhood of Socrates, and
it is unlikely that Socrates missed the opportunity of making his
acquaintance. Plato’s authority for speaking of Zeno, both as talker
and writer, is first-class.
His story is that, when Parmenides and Zeno were in Athens for the
<p>Great Panathenaea, Zeno read his treatise to a small group including
Socrates. Afterwards, Socrates asked him to read over again the first
hypothesis of the first argument. He then repeated it in his own words
so that Zeno could confirm that he had understood it correctly, and
cantinned:?
I see, Parmenides, that Zeno’s intention is to associate himself with you by
means of His treatise no less intimately than by his personal atachment. In
a way, his book states the same position as your own; only by varying the
form he tries to delude us into thinking that his thesis is a different one.®
You assert. . .that the Al is one. . . Zeno, for his part, asserts that it is not a
plutality ; each expresses himself in such a way that your arguments seem to
have nothing in common, though really they come to very much the same
thing. ...
Yes, Socrates, Zeno replied ; but you have nor quite seen the real character
<p>of my book.. .. The book makes no pretence of disguising from the public
the fact that it was written with the purpose you describe. . . . The book is in
fact a sort of defence of Parmenides’ argument against those who                   try to
make fun of it by showing that his supposition, that there is a One, leads to
many absurdities and contradictions. This book, then, is a retort against those</p>

who assert a plurality. It pays them back in their own coin with something
ta spare, and aims at showing that, on a thorough examination, their own
supposition that there is a plurality leads to even more absurd consequences
than the hypothesis of the One. It was written in that controversial spiriz in
my young days; and someone copied it surreptitiously, so that I had not
even the chance to consider whether it should see the light or not.</p>
The setting may be fictional, and perhaps also the story of the un-
<p>authorized publication, though it is no evidence against it that as Zeno
tells it it seems a little inconsistent with his present behaviour in reading
it aloud to an admiring audience. Both alike are elements in Plato’s
story, and it would be logical to play off one against the ather only if
one were in the story and the other an independently attested fact, But
whatever we think of the incidents, we must believe what Plato says
about the content of Zeno’s book,* and start from his statement that
its general purpose was to defend Parmenides’s thesis by showing up
greater absurdities in its contrary. There must have been many who
‘tried to make fun’ of it in the way he describes.</p>
                             (5) Plurality (Lee, x~11)?
<p>Zeno said, according to Themistius (Lee, 1), that unity and indivisi-
bility inevitably go together. In Lee, 2 (Simplicius), we have his proof
that reality is both one and indivisible. Plurality is a self-contradictory
notion hecause {z) it demands a number of (indivisible) units: ‘ plurality
is a collection of units’ (Euderus in Lee, 6; DK, A21); (8) it implies
that reality is divisible. If so, however, it must be infinitely divisible,
for it must be a magpitude, and any magpitude is divisible into parts
which are still magnitudes and so themselves divisible, however small.
But if this is the case, there is nothing that can be called a unit, for any-
thing that one takes as such can still be divided and so is not unitary.
  ¥ “‘Unreservedly”, as Frinkel nghely says (4/P,        1942, 203; Wege u. Formen, 233).        But he
himself seems 10 go rather far in ‘ conjecture or imagination® when he describes Zeno 25 a <em>con-
jurer’, speaks of his </em>swift legerdemain” and says it s * riext to impossible to distinguish the lighter
aspects of hus art from the deep significance of his ideas’. While well aware of cheir prafunduty,
he nevertheless ‘often playfully, lustly, and defiantly deceives and mystifies the reader’. Frankel
quotes Brochard’s description of one aspect of the paradoxes as “une plaisanterie innocente’. At
the tisk of bemng thought lacking in humour, I confess T cannot see Zeno in this light.
  ? The references are to the passages given in Lee’s Zena of Elea, a convenient collection which
is rather fuller than that in DK.</p>

<p>                    Zeno's Arguments against Plurality
Hence, since plurality is a plurality of units, there can be no plurality
either.
  In Lee, 4 (DK, A21), Aristotle criticizes Zeno by saying that on his
own principles if the one itself is indivisible it must be nothing. Appar-
ently Zeno argued that what does not increase a thing when added to
it nor decrease it when subtracted from it has no magnitude, and what
has no magnitude does nat exist; but a point, which is the only in-
divisible unit, must have this character. This must have been aimed at
people who claimed that the things in the world were made up of a
plurality of units having the characteristic of geometrical points; not,
that is, merely the ordinary man who unthinkingly accepts the multi-
plicity of nature, but the Pythagoreans with their confusion berween
geometrical and corporeal entities (for which see vol. 1, 2361, 266).
Simplicius adds from Eudemus (Lee, 5; DX, A16) that Zeno was
<p>credited with saying that if anyone could explain to him the nature of
the unit (that is, evidently, of the units of which they believed the
multiple world to consist), he would be able to admit pluraliry.
A further argument was that things comprising a plurality would be
<p>both infinitely large and infinitely small (Lee, 9 and 10; DX, fir. 1and 2):
(a) Infinitely large. If a thing has size and depth, one part of it must
<p>be separate from another. [Obviously the parts cannot occupy the
same space.]       Now one part of it must be the outer surface, which
limits it, and lies beyond the inner part. If it is merely a geometrical
surface (i.e. with no depth), it is not a part of a solid bady at all, in fact
it is nothing, and the object has no limiting surface; but if it has depth
(i.e. is a solid body isself), then it too must have an outer part or surface
and an inner part, and so on ad infinitum.*
(8) The only alternative is that the parts of each thing have no
<p>magnitude: but an infinite number of parts of no magnitude can never
add up to a magnitude.
 Three remarks may be made on this. First, Frinkel points out that,
<p>since each succeeding “skin’ of an object would be thinner than the last,
its total extension would not be infinite but would converge to a
certain sum.

<p>                                        The Eleatics
 While the construction may go on indefinitely, and the object may continue
 to stretch our and increase, yet, at any stage of the operation, the thing could
 be put into a crate which is Jarger than it is or can ever become (4P, 1942,
 196).
 So a modern mathematician would                    reason, and Frinkel thinks that
Zeno so reasoned too. He would therefore translate apeiron in the
phrase ‘so large as to be apeira in magritude’ by ‘unlimited’ (i.e.
having no definite limit) as distinct from ‘infinite’. This considerably
weakens the force of the antithesis (<em>so great as to be apeird in size and
so small as to have no size atall”) and js unlikely. He cites Anaximander,
for whom, as he rightly says, the word had both meaninés.                        This is
very different from using one to the exclusion of the other. For that
he can only quote Aristotle, 2 more sophisticated logician than esther
Anaximander or Zeno.             Either Zeno himself (which is more likely) did
not distinguish the senses, or he used the ambiguous term dialectically
because he knew his opponents to be incapable of grasping that what
goes on increasing indefinitely need not be actually infinite in size. The
second point is that Zeno commits himself to the statement: ‘ Only that
which has magnitude exists’, which Aristotle interpreted as being a
body.</em> This applies to the units from which his opponents have to
construct their plurality of physical objects, but not, one would sup-
pose, to the one being of Parmenides which he believes in. However,
the purely dialectical nature of Zeno’s reasoning (which all ancient
authorities assert and the existing arguments confirm) puts the historian
at a disadvantage which cannot be wholly overcome.                     He shows that
accepted notions of plurality rest an pretises which make them absurd,
but nowhere positively states the character of the unity in which he
himself believes. Thirdly, this argument refutes (even if not exclusively)
the Pythagorean doctrine that solid, three-dimensional bodies have
their origin in two-dimensional planes.
Finally we have a complementary argument (Lee, 11; DK, fr. 3)
<p>that if there is a plurality, it must contain both a finite and an infinite
number of components: finite, because they must be neither more nor
less than they are; infinite, because if they are separate at all, then how-

<p>           Zeno's Arguments against Plurality and Motion
ever close together they are, there will always be others between them,
and yet others between those, ad infinirum. This is another application
of the hypothesis of infinite divisibility. Frinkel compares the reason-
ing of Plato’s Parm. 165a-b: In any object, if one picks on one point
as the beginning, and another as the centre, there will always be a
beginning of the beginning, and a smaller part in the centre of the centre
and so on.</p>
</p>
</p>
All the above arguments against plurality apply to any sort of
<p>plurality, but in choosing the form of attack shat he did, Zeno must
have had an eye on the Pythagoreans of a generation before the
‘fluxion” method of producing figures and bodies from points. (See
vol. 1, 262.) These had as yet formulated no clear distinction between
a geometrical point and a minimum magnitude, and Zeno faced them
with the dilemma: if the units from which they constructed the world
had no magnitude, then nothing with magnitude could be produced
from themy; if they had, then the infinite divisibility of any quantum
led them to absurdities.</p>
                  (6) Motion - the paradoxes (Lee, 17-36)
<p>Late authorities (Lee, 17-18; DK, fr. 4) give a general argument of
Zena’s against motion, to the effect that if anything moves, it must
move either in the place where it is or in the place where it is not. The
latter is impossible (nothing can act or be acted upon where it isn’),
and where a thing is, it must be at rest. This, however, is very similar
to the paradox of the flying arrow (no. 3 below), and may be only a
condensation        of it      The    arguments        against    motion,      as   given    by
Aristatle in his Physics (239h9.) and amplified by the Greek com-
mentators, are four. These constitute the famous paradoxes of Zeno
on which the attention of philosophers and mathematicians has chiefly
been focused.

becavse an object moving between any two points 4 and B must
always cover half the distance before it gets 1o the end. But hefore
covering half the distance it must cover the half of the half, and so ad
infinirum. Thus to traverse any distance at all it must cover an infinite
number of points, which is impossible in any finite time.
At 233221 Aristotle criticizes this argument by pointing out that
<p>“infinite’ has two senses: to be infinite in divisibility is not the same as
to.be infinite in extent. Any continuum is infinitely divisible, and this
applies to time as well as to space. Hence it is perfectl)g possible to
traverse in a finite time a space which is infinite in divisibility, though
not in extent.      Later in the Physics however, at 263a11, hg returns to
the point and admits that although this is a sufficient atgument ad
hominem against Zeno, it does not {ully and satisfactorily account for
the facts.
1f [he says] one leaves out of account the distance and the question whether
it is possible to traverse an infinite number of distances in a finite time, and
asks the same questions about time itself (for time contains an infinite
number of divisions), this solution will no longer be adequate.</p>
</p>
This second attack on the prablem shows that Aristotle was not un-
<p>aware of its deeper significance, and this awareness, together with his
claim that the earlier answer was sufficient for Zeno, makes it improb-
able that (as some recent writers have claimed) Zeno himself saw all
the implications and Aristotle simply failed to catch his meaning<em>
Aristotle’s own solution involves recourse to the distinction between
potential and actual (one of his own major contributions to thought):
‘In a continuum there is an infinite number of halves, but only potenti-
ally, not actually” (263a28).

that further distance the tortoise will again have moved on, and so on.
As in the dichotomy, Achilles will have to pass through an infinite
number of points to catch up the tortoise, and this is assumed to be
impossible. Aristotle treats this argument as essentially the same as the
dichotomy, and vulnerable to the same criticism. The only difference
is that the dichotomy invalved successive division into equal halves,
whereas this involves division into decreasing portions corresponding
to the relative speeds of the runners.
(3) The flying arrow (Lee, 28—34; DK, a27). The two previous
<p>arguments depended on the assumption that a spatial length could not
be reduced to minimal units but was infinitely divisible. This one, on
the other hand, is only effective on the premise that time consists of
indivisible minimal instants.
The text of the paradox in Aristotle is obscure in detail, and is
<p>probably corrupt and incomplete, but its general tenour is plain
enough and a restoration is possible with the aid of fuller statements in
the Greek commentators.                Zeno seems to have argued that an arrow
which appears to be flying is really stationary because everything that
occupies a space equal to itself must be at rest in that space, and at any
given instanc of its flight (literally, every ‘now’) an arrow can only
occupy a space equal to itself; therefore ar every instant of its flight it
is motionless.
After stating this argument, Aristotle disposes of it by denying that
<p>time is composed of separate moments. Earlier in the Physics he had
argued more fully that it is meaningless to talk of either motion or rest
as taking place in a ‘now’.             Itis true that if we try to describe the state
of the arrow at one instant only, we cannot say that it is either in motion
or at rest, for an instant (in the sense of an indivisible and durationless
nnit of fime corzresponding to a point in geometrical space) is not a
reality but a mental construct.?
  <em> As regards mation his argument runs like chis (2343 24fF.). Motion may be slower or faster.
Now suppose that in a given </em>now’ something traverses the distance 4—B. In the same ‘now’
something moving more slowly will traverse a shorter distance 4-C, which means that the more
rapidly moving object will traverse that distance in less than a <em>now’. This is absurd, for there 13

take the same time to pass an equal number of bodies of the same size,
Therefore (since s, £’s and C’s are all equal), 44 = 24, or alterna-
tively half a given time is equal to the whole. The conclusion, like that
of the other arguments, was a reiteration of Parmenides’s thesis that
motion is unreal,

equal time to pass with equal velocity a body that is in motion and a
body of equal size at rest’ (240a1). This judgment of Aristotle is the
most controversial point in modern interpretations of Zeno, Since
Tannery it has been commonly thought that he could not possibly
have been guilty of such an elementary logical howler. Zeller however
(who argues against Tannery in a footnote) thought it rash to assume
that because the fallacy is obvious at sight to the least philosophical of
us now, it would not be taken setiously by Zeno. The error of assuming
that the space traversed by a body is measured by the size of the body
it passes, whether the latter is stationary or in motion, ‘might well
escape the first man to reflect on the laws of motion in this universal
way, and all the more easily if, like Zeno, he set out with the conviction
that his examination of them would lead to contradictions’ (ZN, 762).
This view has been revived by N. B. Booth, who writes (J#S, 1957,
11, 194): ‘There is no evidence to support the view that Zeno never
made blunders which seem elementary to us now; this is a dogma of
modern thinkers, who fail to take into account either the numerous other
blunders of the Eleatic philosophers or the limitations of the times.””
 Those who believe that in this matter Zeno must have been wronged
<p>by Aristotle defend him on the ground that he was arguing against
opponents who denied the infinite divisibility of matter. If the onkoi
(bodies) represent indivisible minima, then his argument is valid, and
moreover the arguments fall neatly into two pairs, the first two arguing
on the assumption of infinite divisibility and the last two on the contrary
assumption (applied first to time and then to space).? We say that be-
¥ Even nowadays some things have to be said which sound surprisingly elementary.             One
<p>would have thought the time long past when it had to be pointed out that 2 body can only be said
to move in relation to another body; but the following was thought worth writing by Frege in
1891, and was translated and republished in Synthese, 1961, 35013
  “All these discussions (i.e. discussions about men walking backwards on the decks of maving
ships, etc.) can be solved by the insight thar the expression <em> ¢ moves” is incomplete and has 10 be
replaced by the expression “z moves in relation to 5</em>’, The propositions “a moves in relation to
£” and “a does not move in relation to ¢” do not necessarily contradict each other. Also our
physicists will agree that one can never observe the motion of a body as such, but only its motion
in relation to another body.. . Why then was so Jirtle attention paid to it by the physicists?® The
 incomplete expression “a moves™ is so convenient and it is sanctioned by its usage in ordinary
 langnage which is also very often employed in physics.”
 * Tannery, Brochard and others attached much importance to this point tao, that the argu-
<p> Tents are arranged according to a consistent jogical scheme; and this in its turn is denied by
 Zeller and Booth, who say with some justification that Aristotle provides no evidence for it.</p>

cause the C’s are also moving, the first B can pass two C’s in the time
in which it passes one stationary 4. But if so, there must be a period in
which it passes one C, and in that period it will pass half an 4. Com-
mon sense would say that is exactly what it does; but the opponents
whom Zeno has in mind cannot say so, because for them each 4 is an
indivisible minimum passed in an indivisible instant of time.
Such an argument, as Raven says, would certainly be useful against
<p>the Pythagoreans who were still confusing indivisible arithmetical
units with the points in infinitely divisible geometrical magnitudes, and
tacitly assuming (as Zeno assumed for dialectical purposes) that every-
thing that exists has some physical size. Indeed if he intended it,
it considerably strengthens the case of those who believe that in
formulating his arguments he had the Pythagoreans chiefly in mind.
It is of course possible that Aristotle misrepresented Zeno’s thought;
but unfortunately we are in his hands and those of his commentators,
since we have no information from any other source. And they give
no hint that any such further argument occurred, at least explicidy, in
his book. There is no evidence for it, and since they had the whole
book and we have only what they choose to tell us, we are in a weak
position to dispute the point with them. Moreover the considerations
adduced by Zeller and Booth have some weight.?</p>

in addition of those of plurality and motion. Like his other arguments
this one too is made possible by the peculiar philosophical situation in
his time.      No one, that is, had yet conceived the idea of incorporeal
being, although both Heraclitus and Parmenides had in their different
ways brought thought to 2 stage where it needed such a conception if
it was not to be at the mercy of paradox and absurdity. The argument,
which again we owe in the first place to Aristotle, is simple. Every-
thing that exists exists in a place (or occupies a space). Therefore if
place exists, it also exists in a place, and so on ad infinitum. This is
absurd, therefore place does not exist.</p>
        (8) Sensazion: the millet seed (Lee, 37 and 38; DK, 429)
<p>Although there is some doubt about the exact form in which Zeno put
forward this argument (see p. 81 with n. 2 above), it is vouched for
by Aristotle as in essence his own.” It seems to be an extension into a
different field of his attack on infinitesimals, which here serves the
additional Parmenidean purpose of discrediting sensation. Either a
thing has magnitude or it hes not. Similarly, either a thing makes a
sound or it does not. If the interlocutor replies in the affirmative to his
question ‘ Does a single seed make a sound in falling?”, he pursues the
matter by asking whether half a seed makes a sound, and so on. To
the negative reply he rejoins that since a sum of zeros is still zero, there
will be no such thing as sound.                In this way support is given to the
exhortation of Parmenides (fr. 7) that we should not trust the senses.</p>
                            (9) Zeno and Parmenides
<p>It has rightly been pointed out that Zeno’s arguments against motion
are themselves arguments against plurality no less than those which
attack it directly.? Nevertheless this is not necessary as evidence that
he was all the time conducting a ‘defence of Parmenides’ as Plato
  ¥ Against Zafiropoulos attempt to deny Zeno’s anthorship of this argument see Mau, Problem
des Infinitesimalen, 18.
* E.g. Ross, Physics, 72: “The apparent fact of motion, involving the occupation of
<p>different places at different times, is 2 prima facie evidence of plurality, and therefore Zeno tes
to deprive pluralism of this support by proving the non-existence of motion.’ Owen (Proc.

in the attack on plurafity. Cf. also Frankel in 4JP, 1942, 14,

makes him claim to do. The immobility of what is is explicitly asserted

Frinkel sums up well the effect of the arguments against motion in
<p>these words (4P, 1942, 14):</p>
</p>
</p>
</p>
<p>Motion is impossible becanse it cannot in any plausible way p‘netrate the
continua of time, space, and mass. To analyse and justify motion, we must
first of all differentiare within the continua. But if we do set up|a multiple
continuum      and try to make         motion     operate in it, one of two           things will
happen. Either motion will be smothered and brought to a ridiculous stand-
still among the too numerous and too fanciful elements of the artificial
medium; or motion will wreck the articulate continuum by splitting the
units out of which we constructed it. The experiments drastically bear out
the fact that a continuum does not yield to differentiation and plurality. It
is homogeneous.</p>
<p>He then quotes from Parmenides 8. 22 and 25: ‘Nor is it divisible, since
it all equally is. ...* Therefore it is all continuous.” Similarly 8.5 and
6 proclaim that, it ‘now is, all together, one and continuous’.
Zeno in fr. 3 (Lee, 11, pp. 9of. above) says that ‘if there are many
<p>things, they will be infinitein number, for there will always be others
between them, and again others between these’. Frinkel (4] P, 1942,
4) finds this assertion ‘rather startling’, because ‘nowhere does Eleati-
cism deny that two things can be in direct contact’. This is a strange
comment, when we consider that by Eleatic logic two things cannot
even exist. The origin of this argument is also presumably to be found
in Parmenides 8.22~5: “Nor is it divisible. . . but all is full of what is.
Therefore it is all continuous, for what is is close 20 whae is.” With this
go closely v». 45-8:
For it may not be at all greater or smaller in this direction or in that; for
neither is there what is not, which might stop it from reaching its like, nor

Again (4.2) ‘Thou shalt not cut off for thyself<em> what is from contact
with what is”. It is assumed that any two things must be separated if
they are to be two and not one. As Aristotle said (Phys. 263a23),
once we bisect a continuum (mentally or otherwise), we make two
points out of what was one before, for the point at which it is bisected
becomes the end of one half and the beginning of the other; and how
can this happen unless by conceiving the two as separate? But then
what separates them, being a third thing, must itself be separated from
them by something else, and so on. Parmenides’s procedure had been
to deny the divisibility of being by saying that, if it were divided, what
separates its parts must be either what is or what is not. It cannot be
what is not (i.e. emptiness), for that by definition does not exist, nor can
it be what is, for nothing exists besides what is. (‘ The force of evidence
will not suffer anything besides itself to come into being’, 8.12~13.)
Reality being one is continuous, and this depends on its being always
in contact with itself. Hence the Eleatic argues that if reality is many, it
is not continuous and its components are not in contact. There must be
something between them.
Another buttress to the Parmenidean edifice is provided by Zeno’s
<p>additional proof, by infinite regress, of the non-existence of place or
space. Since this was a consequence of the continuity of the one being
as described by Parmenides (p. 33 above), its continuity and unity here
receive further support. A further close connexion berween master
and pupil has been pointed out by Frinkel in a comparison between the
presupposition of the ‘arrow’ paradox and the Parmenidean description
of motion.       In the paradox, the impossibility of motion depends on
supposing it to be of a discontinuous or cinematographic</p>
</em> character,
imagining it in terms of giving up one position in favour of another,
‘or, in short, of an “exchange of position™” (4/ P, 1942, 9). This was
exactly the phrase used by Parmenides in relegating mation to the realm
of empty names which mortals use, beleving them to be realities.3

<p>To conclude, Zeno was a single-minded and enthusiastic disciple of
Parmenides, who brought his remarkable intellectual powers to bear on
one thing only, accurately described by Plato as ‘the defence of the
logos of Parmenides’. All his arguments are aimed at             making men
accept the unpalatable truth that reality is one, indivisible,Jand motion-
less, by the dialectical method of showing up absurdities inithe contrary
hypothesis. Incidentally to this overriding purpose he déveloped the
dialectical method of argument itself, and pointed out logical difficulties
in the conceptions of plurality, motion, time and space which, in the
words of A. E. Taylor, ‘led to a reconstruction of mathematical funda-
mental concepts which began in the age of Plato and has barely been
completed in our own’. His opponents include all who believe that
rabbits run and time passes—all, that is, who follow the dicrates of
common sepse; but the form of his arguments suggests that among
contemporary philosophers he, like his master, had in mind, mainly if
not exclusively, the teaching of Pythagoras and his followers which
had taken such deep root in the soil of his native taly.</p>
                          Note on certain Chinese paradoxes
<p>Needham in his Science and Civilisation in China (11, 190f.) quotes a
list of Chinese paradoxes which were under discussion about 320 B.C.
He notes that one or two are strikingly similar to Zeno’s, thongh,
as he says, it is hard to believe in any transmission or influence.
Such are:

Needham remarks that the second of these is ‘startlingly similar to
Zeno’, but 1 wonder if it is not even more subtle. All Eleaticism
depends on the uncompromising ‘either—or’. There is no hint in Zeno
of a state which is neither motion nor rest. The cut stick on the other
hand makes exactly a point of Zeno’s. (It is also worth comparing the
quotations from the Mohist Canon at 111, 92.) Others in the list remind

                                   (x) Introductory
<p>The only known facts about the public life of Melissus the philosopher,
son of Ithagenes, are surprising but well authenticated.                              He was a
Samian statesman and admiral who took advantage of a tactical error
on the part of Pericles to inflict a resounding defeat on the Athenian
fleet, thereby temporarily relieving the blockade which it was conduct-
ing against his native island. This was recorded by Atistotle, and the
battle, which is mentioned by Thucydides, took place in 441 B.c.<em> His
maturity therefore coincided with the full tide of the Periclean age and
its intellectual ferment in Athens and elsewhere. He wasa contemporary
of Empedocles, Anaxagoras and Herodotus and probably somewhat
older than the atomists Leucippus and Democritus,                              though in our
ignorance we cannot rule out on chronological grounds the view, to
which some have inclined, that the atomists were an influence on his
work rather than vice versa. His writings contain hints of polemic
against all these thinkers, but in the absence of external data their
relationship to him has been a matter of much dispute®
Although a Samian, his acceptance and defence of the main tenets of

Pesicles himselfin a sea-baxle’” (i.e. in addinon to the engagement of 443, in which he seized an
opportunity offered by Pericles’s absence). But Aristotle was doubtless the source of both staries,
which will have come from his Constitution of Samos. Cf. also Plut, Them. 2, ddv. Col. y126b,
and D.L.p.24.

</em> The earliest reference to Melissus by name is in the Hippocratic treatise De natura hominis
(ch. 1, v1, 34 Litré), which is probably of the late fifth century and was attributed by Aristotle
(Hist. anim. §12b 12) 10 Hippocrates's son-in-law Polybus. (See Kahn, Anaximander,           126.)</p>

rejection of the senses) put him philosophically among the Eleatics;
and we may perhaps see here, with Burnet, ‘ the effect of the increased
facility of intercourse between East and West which was secured by
the supretnacy of Athens’ (EGP, 321). The doxographers call him a
pupil of Parmenides, but this they would do in any case on the strength
of his teaching, and we cannot say when, if at all, the two men met.
There are some useful, though sharply critical, references to him in
Aristotle, and Simplicius quotes important verbatim extracts from his
book On Nature or What Is.<em> The treatise On Melissus, Xenophanes,
Gorgias (MXG, for which see vol. 1, 367—70) reproduces L\E content
of the known {ragments reasonably accurately, but adds nothing save
the point that there can be no mixture in the one reality (pp. 11§f.
below). Melissus appears to have confined himself to discussion of
reality and the folly of trusting the senses, without adding any descrip-
tion of the ‘seeming” world corresponding to the second part of Par-
menides’s poem.           Simplicius, who clearly possessed the works of both
philosophers, writes: ‘ Melissus simply says that there is no becoming
at all, whereas Parmenides says that there is in seeming though not in
truth.'
                             (2) The nature of reality
<p>For all his acceptance of the main tenets of Eleaticism, Melissus had a
mind of his own. On the one hand he produces some fresh arguments
in favour of the Parmenidean description of reality, and on the other
he endows it with othes characteristics, one at least of which is in direct
contradiction to his master. It is reasonable to attribute some of 1hese
changes to the fact that he had to meet new conceptions which were
being put forward by other philosophers since Parmenides composed
his poem, and this possibility will be considered in its place. Like

</em> Teis often said that these titles were only given to fifth-century works by Alexandrian scholars,
but this is disproved by the utle maliciously given by Melissus’s contemporary Gorgias 1o his
reversal of Eleatic reasoning: On the Non-existent or on Nature. That thiswas a direct allusion to
Melissus is doubted by Nestle (RZ,%v, 1, s31)on the grounds that the parodyis directed against
Parmenides himself. Tt of course atracks the whole Eleatic position, and in any case according to
Simplicins Parmenides and Melissus gave their worksthe same title (De caelo, 556.25). Simplicius

<p>                    Reality according to Melissus
Zeno he wrote in prose, and exhibits none of the religious exaltation
which overflows from the prologue into the main poem of Parmenides
with its solemn pronouncements abour the actions of Dike, Ananke
and Moira. His preference is for explicit, pedestrian, and sometimes
wearjsomely repetitive argumentation.</p>
</p>
<p>(a) Reality has the characteristics stated by Parmenides and others
consistent with them
Melissus follows Parmenides in holding that reality is one and un-
<p>divided, ungenerated and everlasting, homogeneaus, motionless and not
subject to grawth or change; and that in consequence the senses canniot
witness to the truth. Butadifference between the twomen appears at once
in their expression of a fundamental property of reality: its eternity.
‘It was not nor shall it be, since it now is’, said Parmenides (8.5); but
Melissus, as if deliberately, brings this back to the plane of common
sense by writing (fr. 2), ‘It is and always was and always shall be’. The
easily comprehensible notion of everlastingness replaces the more pro-
found one of timelessness. The impossibility of becoming he demon-
strates on purely Parmenidean lines (fr. 1):
For if it came into being, before it came into being there must have been
nothing; if there were nothing, nothing would ever come into being out of
nothing.
Elsewhere also he either repeats or develops arguments of Par-
<p>menides, for example in fr. 7.2—3, which is a not unfair specimen of
his verbosity. He is arguing that what is cannot perish or grow or alter:
For if it were to undergo any of these things, it would no longer be. For if
it changed, what is would of necessity not be homogeneous, but what
formerly was must perish, and what is not must come to be. If then it were
to alter by a single hair in ten thousand years, in the fulness of time it will
perish entirely. Nor is it possible for it to be rearranged, for the previously
existing order does not perish, nor the order which is not come to be. And
when nothing is added nor perishes nor is altered, how could it still exist if
the order were changed? For if something became different, it would at the
same time have its order changed.
It seems   unnecessary to argue against change of order (kosmos)
<p>when reality is one and without parts.           But according to MXG,
                                  103
<p>                                      The Eleatics
Melissus felt that to assure the unity of reality, he must defend it
against the idea that it was ‘one by mixture’. Evidently he was already
aware of pluralist reactions against Parmenides like that of Empedocles.
(See pp. 115£. below.) The picturesque addition about alteration of a
single hair in ten thousand years was perhaps motivated by the thought
that, if change is admitted ar all, then Heraclitus had shown that it
must be continuous even if imperceptible (vol. 1, 451£.).
Parmenides had been content to attribute the immobility of what is
<p>to the mighty bonds of Ananke (pp. 34f. above). Meliss;us demon-
strates it explicitly from the absence of void, which also is stated and
argued (fr. 7.7):
Nor is there any void, for void is nothing, and nothing cannot be\l Nor does
it {se. what is] move, for it has no place to which it can withdraw, but is full.
If there were void, it would withdraw to the void; but since there is no void,
it has nowhere to withdraw to.
This open rebuttal of the void by name (kenon = emptiness or what is
empty) is not to be found in Parmenides, whereas Melissus gives it
considerable prominence, so that it has even been possible for scholars
to argue that he was the first to make use of the idea. (Seep. 36, n. 1
above.) This new emphasis may have a hearing on his relation to the
atomists, who accepted void as an essential feature of their cosmogony.
From the absence of void Melissus points out that what is can con-
<p>1ain no variations of density and rarity, as Anaximenes and those who
followed him believed (7.8):
And there cannot be dense and rare, for it is impossible that what is rare should
be as full as what is dense, but the rare is emptier than the dense. The decision
to be made about full and not full is this: if a thing has room for something
else, and takes it in, itis not full; butif    it does not have room to take it in, it is
full. Now it must be full if there is no void, and if it is full it does not move.
The sudden switch back 1o the question of motion, which had been
<p>settled earlier in the fragment, is typical of the irritating form of
Melissus’s argumentadion. In the disproof of degrees of density and
rarity he is develaping a hint of Parmenides (8.23£):
It does not exist more fully in one direction, which would prevent it from
holding together (or being continuous), nor more weakly in another, but all
is full of what is.

<p>       Melissus Denies Plurafity, Void, Divisibility, Change
The indivisibility of what is, which Parmenides (8.22) had rested
<p>simply, and perhaps a little cryptically, on the siatement that ‘it all
equally is’, Melissus deduces from its immobility (fr. 10):
For if what is is divided, it moves; but if it moved, it would no longer be.
This rather curious argument shows that he has in mind only the
division of realicy as an accomplished fact. That it mightbe theoretically
divisible (as in fact any magnitude must be), without ever being actually
divided, is something that he does not consider.
In his denial of plurality, and hence of all sensible objects and
<p>qualities, he also adopts a more elaborate line of argument (fr. 8.2-6).
As examples he cites the four elements, earth, water, air and fire
(another pointer to Empedocles), metals, colours, hot and cold, hard
and soft, living and dead.® Men believe that these exist, and that change
occurs from one to the other, so that, for example, hard iron is worn
away by contact with the finger, water changes to earth and stone,
and <em> we sce and hear aright’. This is false because, if these things existed,
then it follows from criteria of existence already established thar (3.2)
each must be such as it appeared to us at first, and not change nor become
different, but each must always be as it is.
But (8.4-6)
all seem to us to become different and to change from their appearance at
any particular timme. Evidently then we did not see aright nor do those many
things rightly seem to be, for they would not change if they were real, but
each would be such as it seemed; for nothing is stronger than that which
truly exists.&gt; But if it changes, wliat is has perished and what is not has come
into being. Thus if there were many things, they would have to be such as
the One is.
The conclusion, which Melissus set at both the beginning and the
<p>end of this section, is his own, and constitutes a rather neat reductio ad
absurdum of plurality, particularly in view of two characteristics of his
one reality which still remain 10 be considered.                  It may be added that

<p>(8) Reality is infinite
Parmenides had laid great emphasis on the finite character of the real,
<p>claiming that this was essential to its wholeness and perfection and
buttressing it with solemn religious sanctions. 1have tried tg show how
at his stage of thought it was possible to combine this with the con-
viction that nothing, not even empty space, existed outside it.<em> It is
here that Melissus makes a radical departure from his mastet. What is,
he says, has no bounds or limits (perara), but is in fact apeiron, infinite.
He does not argue against Parmenides, so we do not know how he
would have met the point thar limits were necessary for its complete-
ness; but he recognizes the difficulty of imagining anything as bounded
if it is not bounded by something. So fax as his own words go, we meet
this only at a later stage, when he is arguing, not for the infinity of
what s, but from its infinity, as an established premise, to its unity.
He inferred its unity from its infinity on the argument ‘if it were not one, it
would come up against [or be limited by] something else’ (fr. 5, Simpl.).
Again (fr. 6):
To be infinite, it must be one; for if there were two, they could not be
infinite but would have limits in relation to {or be limited by] one another.
  Tt is true that Melissus had other excellent arguments, inherited from
Parmenides, for the unity of reality; but, as we see, he did rest it also
on its infinity, and this he attempted to prove, unfortunately for our
good opinion of him, in ways which show him to have been still
capable of a rather primitive confusion of thought. Aristotle indeed
comes to his rescue here with the information that he had one good
argument. Simplicius does not quote it, nor have we it in Melissus’s
own words at all, and in fact Aristotle does not name Melissus as its
author. Nevertheless it is too similar to the arguments already quoted
to have come from anyone else, and it is interesting that we should owe
it to Aristotle, who had such a low opinion of Melissus that he called

absurdity is granted and the rest follows; that is simple enough.’
(Meraph. 986b26, Phys. 185a10.)                    What Aristotle says is:
They say that the All is one, unmoved and infinite; for a limit would bring
it up against the void.<em>
This of course is the objection that naturally occurs to a modern reader
confronted with Parmenides’s statement that the total sum of existence
is bounded and spherical in shape.
But Melissus also proved the infinity of reality at greater length in a
<p>more questionable way. Having shown by Parmenidean arguments
that what is can never have come into being, he continued (fr. 2):
Since then it did not become, it is and always was and always will be, and
has neither beginning nor end but is infinite. For if it came to be, it would
have a beginning (having come into being, it must have become at some time)
and an end (for having come to be, it would at some time have ceased);</p>

that what is is necessanly one and unmoved’.
  The possibility must be allowed ¢hat althaugh the explanataey clause can refer to the property
of infimty alone, this sentence may be no more than a rough rewording of Melissus’s own fir. §
and 6, in which the infinity of the real is assumed, and its unity deduced therefrom on the ground
that plurality would involve Limits and so be incompatible with infinicy. I prefer however to take
the more charitable view that Aristotle has preserved here a sound argument of Melissus’s against
finitude, in spite of the fact that Melissus adduces an illogical one as well.
 
</em> The translation here follows DK. There is some doubt whether ywéyevov or yevdvevoy
represents what Melissus wrote. ywépevov occurs in the full quotation each time Simplicius gives
it (Phys. 29.24-5 and 109.20-3). But 1n the latter place he repeats it followed by &amp;vin the second
parenthesis (which if correct would necessitate the translation given above), and tn his exegesis he
repeats the word as yevéuvov. Spengel (Eudemi frr. 18) restored yevdpsvov in the main quotation
and Diels followed him. ywéuevov makes possible, though not necessary, the translation of
Burnet (EGP, 322): ‘it would liave ceased ta come into being ac some tume o another”. So also
KR, 209: ‘it would at some time have stopped coming into being’, Kahn (Feszschr, Kapp, 23)
and Cherniss (4CP, 70) translate similarly. Ross (Physics, 472) thinks the meaning is: ‘it
must have had a (spatial) beginning (i.e. 2 part which came first into heing) and a (spatial) end
(i.e. a part which came last into being)". Although Melissus did believe this, the presence of wove
makes it impossible that he should be saying so here.

since it neither began nor ended, it always was and always will be and has no
heginning nor end; for it is impossible for anything to exist for ever unless
it exists as a whole.
  From this fragment alone, one might suppose Melissus to be simply
making the obvious point that what has no beginning nor end is
infinite in temporal duration. We have seen, however (vol. 1, 86, 337),
that earlier Greek thinkers experienced difficulty in separating the
various senses in which something could be said to be imnite or un-
limited (apeiron), and Melissus was no exception.                          His        thought must
have been something like this, though the steps in the argument were
doubtless not taken consciously: ‘Reality is ungenerated,lstherefore it
has no beginning nor end; what has no beginning nor end is infinite
(apeiron, without perata or limits), and what has no limits is spatially
as well as temporally unlimited, since limits in space are peraza just as
much as those in time.” A brief aside of Aristotle’s makes it easier to see
how the matter presented itself (Phys. 186a11-14). If something has
abeginning, he says, Melissus thought of it as ‘in every case a beginning
of the thing, not of the time’, i.e. the beginning in his view attached
itself to the object generated rather than the time of generation. The
generation of, say, an anima] starts of course at a particular time, but
it also starts at a particular point in space, with a microscopic part of
what grows into the large creature that it finally becomes. If, then, a
thing has no beginning; it has no starting-point in space, i.e. no
boundary.?
  <em> The last clause is a restatement of the argument against coming-to-be. This is a process,
which must occupy time, and during that time the thing which is in process of coming to be must

is tacitly correcting the reasontng of Parruenides, for whom if reality was to contain everything,
it had to be finite or completed (tevereoutver, ol &amp;reheterov): if it had no end it would be
“lacking” (fr. 8.32, 42).

<p>                         Melissus’s Proofs of Infinity
Atistotle also made his criticism in logical form, accusing Melissus
<p>of the illegitimate conversion of a universal affirmative propasition.
Two of his several statements of this criticism are these:
Such is the argument of Melissus that the All is infinite.                  He takes as his
premise that the All is ungenerated             (for nothing can be generated from
nothing), and that everything that is generated has a beginning. If then the
All was not generated, it has no beginning, so that it is infinite. But this does
not necessarily follow. It is not true that if everything generated has a
beginning, everything that has a beginning is generated, any more than if
everyone in a fever is hot, everyone who is hot has fever.
The argument of Melissus also depends on this [i.e. illegitimate conversion];
for he claims that if what is generated has a beginning, what is ungenerated
has no beginning, so that if the universe is ungeneraied it is also infinize. This
is not true, for the sequence is the other way round.!
There is no flaw in arguing that what is ungenerated has no zemporal
<p>beginning, and in censuring Melissus Aristotle must be using the word
‘infinite’ in the most general sense, including spatial infinity. That he
was justified in attributing this extension to Melissus appears from two
further direct quotations in Simplicius. For the conversion we havefr. 4:
Nothing which has a beginning and an end is either everlasting or infinite,
where the use of the word apeiron as well as “everlasting’ (&amp;iSiov)
shows that more than temporal infinity is intended. Finally in fr. 3
Melissus is even more explicit:
But just as it is for ever, so it must be infinite in magnitude.
1 would emphasize that different interpretations of Melissus’s views
<p>on this point are possible. (See in particular that of Cherniss referred
to in n. 1 to p. 108 above.) What is undoubted is that he contradicted
Parmenides by holding that reality is infinite in magnitude, and
achieved an intellectual advance by raising the question: if reality is
both one and finite, what are its Jimits? What does it border on? Not
on the void, for that is non-existent; nor on something else, for then
there must be more than one reality.?

<p>(¢) Reality has no body
We come now to one of the most difficult of all Melissus’s pro-
<p>nouncements, Simplicius writes:
That he means reality to be incorporeal he declares in the words: ‘If it
exists it must be one, and being one it must have no body. Ifit had thickness,
it would have parts, and would no longer be one.™
It seems then that Melissus asks us to reconcile the following state-
ments:
(r) Reality is infinite in magnitude.
(2) There is no emptiness in it but it is *full”.
(3) It has no body.
<p>It is not surprising that to some scholars this has seemed impossible.?
The dilemma is generally put in the form: Is reality corporeal or
<p>incorporeal? That is, Melissus’s sentence ‘It must have no body
(soma)’ is taken as meaning that it is incorporeal in the full sense which
that word carries today. This is not necessarily true. One of the plainest
lessons of Presocratic thought is that the notion of incorporeal exis-
tence was not achieved by a single step, but was a gradual process,
Aristotle, for whom             it was an accomplished fact, rightly uses the

sufficiently to be of use in deciding the question whether these words refer, as some have thought,
not to the Eleatic One Being but o each of a plurality of units such as was believed in by those
whom Zeno attacked (pp- 88—91 above). This theory, according to which Simplicius completely
misunderstood Melissus in spite of having his book camplete, seems to me highly improbable and

it is put succinctly by Nesdle in RE, xv, 1, 531 It is no argument in favour of it that Aristatle

Burnet and Nestle. Vlastos's normally acute reasoning is here fatally weakened by his argument
that the combination of the incorporeslity of Being with its infinity is possible for Melissus simply
“because the infinity in question is that of beginningless and endless duration, not that of un-
limited spatial extension’. This is irreconcilable with the phrase &amp;mapov T péyedos in fr, 3, which

<p>                  Reality has no Body or Thickness
adjective asomaton (bodiless) in comparative and superlative forms
when speaking about his predecessors. In choosing their primary
substance, or considering the composition of the soul, they inclined
towards what was ‘more incorporeal’, or nearer to incorporeality, by
reason of fine texture, lightness or mobility. Thus fire is ‘the most
incorporeal’ of the elements, air is ‘more incorporeal’ than water.®
In his important article on the word asomaton, H. Gomperz reminds
<p>us that in its earliest contexts (that is, in Homer) soma meant a corpse.
It was rapidly extended to apply to the body of a living human being
or animal, and this remained its practically universal significance in
classical literature. When in philosophical contexts, and probably not
before the late fifth century,? it was extended to include physical body
in general, it was still confined (as Gomperz notes) to that which
possessed two essential properties of organic bodies: perceptibility to
the senses (especially touch and sight) and inclusion within definite
spatial boundaries. An entity can therefore be described as ‘not having
a soma’ if it is intangible and invisible and has no boundaries (is
apeiron), characteristics that we know already to belong to the Being
of Melissus. It is also understandable that to have a soma involves
having parts and being divisible, and on this ground too an Eleatic
would have to deny the somatic character of the real.
The denial of ‘thickness’ (packos) is more difficult to grasp. One
<p>must agree with Theodor Gomperz (Gr. Th. 1, 190) that Melissus was
not simply denying a third dimension to reality and reducing it to a
two-dimensional plane. He was in fact in a rather tight corner. He still
wished to uphold the main Eleatic thesis of the unity, imperceptibility,
indivisibility etc. of reality, but being aware of certain difficulties in the
first statement of it by Parmenides, and also in all probability of the
penetrating arguments of Zeno, he was forced to introduce refinements
! For examples see H. Gomperz, Hermes, 1932, 167, n. 3. Raven (P. and E. 89~92) has some
<p>sensible things to say against over-simplification of this question.
  * Apart from the present passage (and it is by na means certain that Being was inanimate for
Melissus), I doubt if there is any occurrence of oéux relating 10 inanimate objects in the fifth
century except in Gorgias’s parody of Eleatic reasoning (fr. 3, DK, 11, 281) and perhaps, if it is
genuine, Philolaus fr. 12. In Gorg. fr. 11 (iid. 290.x7) Myos is personified. For Diogenes of
Apollonia &amp;#p, which he called an d8évarrov adiye, was both animate and intelligent, In tragedy
(where it is frequent), Thucydides, and other non-philosophical literature otua isalways the body
of a man or animal.   T suggest that in Melissus fr. 9 the translation of DK should run ‘so darf
es keinen Leib besitzen’, not “Karper’.</p>

into what was already a highly paradoxical doctrine. Parmenides had
spoken of ‘what is’ as bounded like a sphere, with centre and circum-
ference. Was not this to introduce parts into it and endanger its unity
and indivisibility? Zeno had argued that whatever exists must have
magnitude ard thickness (packos), with one part alongside anather. He
was attacking the champions of plurality, but the argument could all
too easily be turned against the Parmenidean One. Such dilernmas
remained unavoidable until the concept of fully incgrporeal, non-
spatial existence was entertained, and thar was not irez. Aristotle
throws some light on the situation as he looks back opn the Eleatics
from the Platonic point of view. For him reality was dijided into the
realm of physical nature and the higher realm of imelligibﬁe and eternal
entities, incorporeal and beyond the confines of space and time. They
were the objects of different studies, physike and first philosophy or
theologike. The Eleatic conception was still monistic; their arguments
had deprived reality of sensible qualities without lifting it out of the
spatial order. Therefore Aristotle writes of Parmenides and Melissus
in De caelo (298bar):
They however, being unaware of the existence of anything beyond the
substance of sensible objects, and perceiving for the first time that unchange-
able entities were demanded if knowledge and wisdom were to be possible,
transferred to sensible objects the description of the higher.
In other words, the Eleatics were trying to give to reality the intelligi-
bility and eternal changelessness of a Platonic or Aristotelian pure
form without its transcendence.       In doing so, they naturally brought
philosophy to a very difficult stage at which it could not, and did not,
rest. Pachos, which one might translate ‘palpable density’, evidently
suggested to Melissus both the compaosite and the sensible, and so was
ruled out as an attribute of the one Being. Being is ‘full’, and infinitely
extended in space, but the notion of density or rarity cannot be applied
to it: ‘there cannot be denseand rare’ (fr.7.8). Scholars who have tried
to confine Melissus within later thought-categories, making him answer
questions like ‘is it corporeal or incorporeal?’, have felt bound to
reject one or other of his statements on the grounds that taken together
they are self-contradictory and unintelligible. I should claim that self-
contradiction and unintelligibility have not quite been reached, though
                                   I12

they are not far off.            Certainly thought could go no further in this
direction. It had to make a fresh start, but not without taking the
Eleatics into account. The directions in which it will now go are largely
determined by the Eleatic experiment.                    It was in the interests of intel-
lectual progress that monism should be carried to its extreme before it
was abaadoned.</p>
</p>
<p>(d) Reality feels no pain
In the list of attributes, mostly negative, of ‘what is’, after saying
<p>that it is everlasting, infinite, one and homogeneous, that it neither
perishes nor grows nor changes, Melissus adds surprisingly that it feels
neither pain nor grief.! Later in the fragment he expands this:
Nor does it feel pain. It could not be entire if it were in pain, for a thing in
pain could not be for ever, nor has it the same power as what is healthy.
Nor would it be all alike if it were in pain, for it would feel pain by the addi-
tion or subtraction of something, and would no longer be alike. Nor could
what is healthy feel pain, for then what is and is healthy would perish, and what
is not would come to be. And the same argument applies to grief as to pain.
The arguments adduce nothing new. Pain is incompatible with com-
pleteness and with the rule that reality must not undergo addition,
subtraction or destruction. The interesting thing is that Melissus should
think the point worth mentioning at all. Zeller wiote that the denial of
pain to reality need not mean that he ascribes to it an unbroken sen-
sation of wellbeing or bliss, ‘so long as it remains unproven that he
ascribed to it any sensation at all’. This is unreasonably sceptical. To
say of something that it ‘feels neither pain nor pleasure’, or any other
pair of contrary sensations, might indeed be a mode of denying it any
feeling at all; but to mention the absence of pain alone would be a
strange way for anyone to describe something completely insensitive.
Others have gone to the opposite extreme and seen in the words an
element of mysticism, or even the origin of the ontological proof of
the existence of God.?

<p>                                        The Eleatics
Without going as far as this, we may take the words as a timely re-
<p>minder that in the normal belief of early Greek thought the ultimately
real is alive and divine. It was so for the Milesians, the Pythagoreans
and Heraclitus. It was so for Xenophanes, to whose one unmoving
god Eleatic thought owed much of its inspiration. If we look ahead
to the immediate successors of the Eleatics, who conscientiously
retained as much of their thought as was consistent with ‘saving the
phenomena’, we find the sphere of Empedocles <em> rejoicing yn its circular
stillness” and ‘a sacred mind darting through the whole cpsmos’. For
Anaxagoras Mind, ‘alone and by itself”, controfled the cosn?ic processes.
There is no evidence that any philosopher entertained the concept of
lifeless matter before the atomists Leucippus and Democritus, and for
all except Parmenides and Zeno there is positive evidence that reality
was alive.” With these two there is at Jeast nothing to suggest that they
were exceptions, and taking into account the theology of Parmenides’s
teacher Xenophanes, and the reference to freedom from pain in his
follower Melissus, it is more likely than not that he too took for granted
that reality was alive. The almost casual way in which Melissus intro-
duces this particular characteristic alongside the known properties of
Eleatic Being strongly suggests that the assumption naturally under-
lying it could simply be wken for granted. So far as they go, these
considerations perhaps support those scholars who would identify
being and thought in Parmenides, for the life of ‘what is” could hardly
be manifested in any other activity but thinking (noein). But on this it
is scarcely possible to dogmatize> Against those who speak of
mysticism and proofs of the existence of God, it is necessary to point
out that, even if Parmenides and Melissus retained, almost automatically,
this legacy from earlier thought, their remains show that it was of little
importance to them.
  ' Aetus does in fact say that for Parmenides ‘the motionless and finite spherical’ was god,
and for Melissus and Zeno “the One and the All” (DX, 28, 31 and 30, A13). His summary list of
¢he gods of all philosophess (Dox. 305—1) does 1ot inspire confidence, but there may have been
some basis for his statements. Olympiodorus also speaks of Melissus’s belief in the divinity of the
one eality, but his language betrays considerable confusion, (DK, a13: he calls it the &amp;px mévrev

<p>                   Relation of Melissus to Qther Philosophers</p>
                              (3) Relation w other philosophers
 The reaction against Eleatic paradox was not long in coming, In the
second half of the fifih century Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and the
atomists Leucippus and Democritus all sought in different ways to
circumvent the logic of Parmenides and by pluralistic theories restore
reality to the everyday sensible world. Mefissus remained an Eleatic,
bur he was a contemporaty of these others, and the external data are
tao scanty to determine the relative chronology of their work.                              Some
however       have     seen     indications      in the      fragments        themselves     that
Melissus was aware of the arguments of the pluralists.
   In fr. 7.8 he is pretty clearly tilting at an Ionian predecessor, Anaxi-
<p>  menes, and his contemporary follower Diogenes of Apollonia, when he
  denies variations of dense and rare, and again in 8. 3 when he mentions
  the opinion that earth and stones come from water, There are no obvious
  signs of an interestin Pythagoreanism, though Raven thinks it ‘tenable’
  that the objection voiced by Melissus against the finite character of the
  Parmenidean One(that ifitis finiteand spherical theremustbe something
  outside it} was not his own but had its arigin in Pythagorean criticistn.?
 In fr. ro Melissus denies the partition of reality, and according to
<p> MXG he also denied that it could be a mixrure. Both denials follow
 from its unity and immobility, and the fact that he thought it worth
 while both to state and argue them separately is attributed by Zeller
 to a desire to refute Empedocles, who tried to escape the Eleatic objec-
 tions to generation and destruction by reducing them to processes of
 mixture and separation of indestructible elements. Zeller might have
 gone further. For instance fr. 7. 3 points in the same direction:
 Nor is it possible for it to be rearranged, for the previously existing order
 (kosmos) does not perish, nor the order which is not come to be.?
' P. and E. 79-82. The second of his three arguments, thac the objection was raised by a
<p>Pythagorean (Archytas) at a fater date, is a dubjous ally, The other two are circumstantial, and
Raven himself is the first to admit that the suggestion is incapable of proof.
  Those who believe that fr. 9 was written in criticism of the units composing a plurality (p. 10,
n. 1 above) believe it to be aimed at the Pythagoreans (Burnet, EGP, 327).

<p>                                        The Eleatics
Empedocles spoke of the elements as ‘at one time coming together by
the agency of Love into one £osmos, and at another scattering apart’,
‘unceasingly changing places’, and ‘running through one another’.t
The language of Empedocles may also have occasioned the curiously
elaborate arguments which Melissus put forward against the notion of
mixture. 1t is true that we have not his own words here, but according
to the report of MXG he defined ‘unity in the sense of mixture™ as
occurring when ‘there are many things moving into one apother’. It
could be of two sorts, by combination (cUvesis) or by I'a kind of
superposition (¢mimpéodnois) brought about by overlapping (or inter-
lacing, ¢m&amp;MAcgis)’. Neither case is compatible with tran&amp;formanon
into a true unity,’ since the elements retain their distinctive: identities
and could be separated again.
Again, it is believed with good reason that Empedocles was the first
<p>to specify the four elements earth, water, air and fire as the ultimate
components of the universe; and in his denial of physical substances
and qualities in fr. 8 Melissus leads off with just these four. Little doubt
can be lefi that he was aware of this attempt to evade Eleatic logic by a
resort to pluralism, and did his best to defeat it.
In the arguments of fr. 8 against the sensible world some have seen
<p>an attack on Anaxagoras, but they seem to have no more specific target
than the general tendency of mankind to helieve their senses.¢

  It is possible that Melissus was attacking plurahism on a wider frone. Apelt (J25.f. Philol. 1886,
739L)   suggested   with some   plausibihty that    n    usmg   the wards   ouweots, émumpdonors and
#méaho€is he mayhave had atomistic modes of combination in mind. Apelt also points ont that the
fact that only mechanical mixture had been conceived of by Melissus’s time, not chemical (which
appears first in Aristotle,cf. GC,1. 10), played into hishands:no mixture could producea true unity.

<p>Others translate ‘neither happens’, attributing 1o Melissus an un-Eleatic appeal 1o experience. If
this is correct, he presumably made use of it as a sufficient argumentum ad homines.
  ¢ “The language seems more applicable to him than anyone else’, Burnet, EGF, 328. Raven
too thinks this suggestion probable, KR, 305, 364. Nestle bowever (ZN, 774 n.) found ‘insuffi~
cient ground’ for Burnet’s suggestion, and Loenen (Parm. Mel. Gorg.1691.) agrees thar Melissus’s

<p>                Melissus, Empedocles and the Atomists
Finally there are the atomists. In this connexion much has been
<p>made of the conclusion expressed by Melissus in fr. 8: ‘If there were
many things, they would have to be such as the Oneis.” Itis commonly
held that the atomism of Leucippus and Democritus was a response to
this challenge:* there swere many things with the properties of the Eleatic
One—indestructibility, homogeneity, indivisibility, lack of internal
change—though they were microscopic in size and innumerable. They
were however subject to mation in space (for in spite of the Eleatics
there was such a thing as empty space), and this brought about their
collision and mutual entanglement out of which the universe with all
its apparent variety was built up. Except for the reference to Melissus
this is, roughly, Axistotle’s account of the atomic theory, and there is
no reason to doubt it.
 Obviously, however, such a theory might have been already pro-
<p>duced in answer to Parmenides and Zeno, and to Zeller the argument
used by Melissus against motion, that it presupposes void and void
cannot exist because what exists is full, was clear evidence of an acquain-
tance with atomic doctrine, which therefore must have preceded his
own.    Nestle followed him in supposing Melissus to be conducting a
defence of Eleaticism against the atomists. The sequence would then be
this. Before Parmenides the notion of a true void had not been grasped:
the Pythagoreans for instance confused it with air. The arguments of
Parmenides made such loose thinking impossible for the future, but
concentrating as he did on the attributes of reality, it was only by
implication that he denied the void. He does not mention it, but only says
that what is is continuous and all is full of what is (fr. 8.23~5, pp. 31—4
above). The atomists saw the implications, brought them into the open
and denied them. Consequently Melissus had to be equally explicit,
mentioning void or emptiness by name and denying its existence.
 Tt must be admitted that the sentence ‘if there were many, they would
<p>have to be such as the One is” by no means proves that Melissus came
first and the atomists took up ‘his challenge. In the context of its
argument it follows from one thing only: the immutability of what
refers to Anaxagoras’s theory that perception was &amp;t per&amp; Mamyg and involved mévos. See
Theophr. De sensu 29 (DX, 59, A92), Arist. EN, 1154b7, EGP, 326 (p. 318 below). This
seems even more dubious.

exists. Even if we were right, he says, in supposing that the four
elements, metals, living and dead, black and white, etc., had reality,
our senses must yet be liars when they show us these phenomena as
changing: if they were real, they would have to remain always the same,
Then follows the sentence in question, in which he evidently has
primarily, and perhaps for the moment solely, in mind the immuzability
of the One. If however one takes the sentence by itself and gives it its
full universal content (“such as the One is in every respect”) then it is
not true that each atom fulfils the requirements, fox the Oné is infinite
in size and has no ‘body’ (i.e. himited and tangible bulk). The atoms
are small and in the aggregate tangible.! It remains a possii:ility that
the atomists may have been indebted to Melissus for the concept of the
infinity of reality, although they applied it not to the individual ‘ones’
or atoms but to their aggregate and the space in which they moved. In
both the Ionian and the Eleatic traditions it was probably a universal
notion, consciously or unconsciously entertained, that the whole sum
of existence was contained within a spherical boundary, with no need
felt to ask the question whether anything lay beyond it. This may even
be true of Anaximander.                 (See vol. 1, 85.)          Yet if predecessors are
necessary, infinite void could equally well have been developed by the
atomists from Pythagorean ideas.
To conclude, certainty is difficult 1o attain when we depend entirely on
<p>internal evidence, and that in a fragmentary state, Even this however
enables one to say with confidence that Melissus was already acquainted
with the poems of Empedocles, though it is not sufficient to give a
decisive answer to the question of priority between him and Anaxagoras
or the atomists. All were alive and active during the same period,
Ancient authorities were divided on whether Leucippus came from
Miletus or Elea. If the former, the Samian admiral may well have known
him. Whether he did, and whether he read the books of Leucippus’s
fellow-atomist from Abdera, we cannot hope to know at this distance of
time. For the history of thought the important thing is that Melissus was
firmly in the Eleatic tradition, whereas the atomists were post-Eleatic in
the sense that they consciously reacted against Parmenidean doctrine.
* Calogero (Studs sull’ Elear. 83, 1. 1) also sees no necessity to suppose that Melissus’s sentence
<p>foreshadows atomism, and Lee (Z. of E. 113) calls it *the famous fragment on atomism’,</p>

          IONIANS AND ELEATICS:
      THE RISE AND FALL OF MONISM
<p>Our next concern will be with the advocates of pluralistic systems,
since the one remaining monist, Diogenes of Apollonia, wrote after
them and with knowledge of their work. It may be worth pausing
first to look briefly back on the development of monism.
Otto Gilbert, in an interesting article published in 1909, argued for
<p>a much closer relationship between Ionian and Eleatic monism than is
usually conceded. Externally there is a remarkable geographical inter-
locking: Xenophanes from Colophon, a near neighbour of Miletus,
migrated to the West and probably taught Parmenides, and Melissus
the ‘Eleatic’ came from Samos.            Philosophically, Gilbert saw a strong
affinity in fundamentals, ranging both schools on the same side against
the common view of reality as a casual aggregate of independent things
or substances.      Both believed in an ultimate, ungenerated unity. This
One was for the Ionians everlasting, divine, and co-extensive—indeed
identical—with the world and all that existed. In the wordsof Diogenes,
the last representative of this tradition (fr. 2): ‘My opinion is, in sum,
that all existing things are differentiated from the same thing and are
the same thing’, and this is the view attributed by Aristotle to the
earlier philosophers in the same tradition, when he tepresents them
(Metaph. 983b8) as positing ‘that from which all existing things are,
ont of which they first come to be and into which they are resolved in
the end, the substance persisting but changing in its affections’.
  These thinkers, then, shared with their Eleatic critics the fundamental
tenets that reality was one, ungenerated and everlasting, and in all
probability alive and divine." They did not, like the ‘lowing philo-

Becoming, permanence and change, unity and plurality, identity and
difference in a single system. So much is true of the Milesians. Hera-
clitus is a unique and complex case, but in spite of the logos-fire, his
doctrines that strife was the condition of existence, opposites identical,
and everything in continuous motion and change, were a powerful
influence undermining Being in favour of Becoming. Xenophanes
made the first move towards a stricter notion of unity which excluded
altogether the possibility that the cosmos could have been ienerated.
In Gilbert’s belief his cosmic deity anticipated the Eleatit one by
excluding any form of motion whatsoever. 1 have given reasons for
doubting this (vol. 1, 382), but certainly he prepared the way for the
transition from Ionian to Eleatic monism by his insistence that the one
god who is the sum of all that exists is ungenerated and cannot move
from place to place.
The achievement of Parmenides was to demonstrate by logical argu-
<p>ment that Being and Becoming were mutually exclusive. The choice
must be made, and its outcome was not in doubt: something must
exist. ‘Itis’; therefore ‘becoming and perishing have been driven afar
off”. If Being excludes Becoming, and Being is one, all plurality is
banished to the realm of deceptive appearance. The spherical shape of
the one existent Parmenides retained from Xenophanes. The Eleatics
(in words of Apelt which have been sufficiently confirmed in the
previous pages) present us with * the exaltation of the bare mathematical
form of the world into its essential character’, while at the same time
‘it must be recognized that neither Melissus nor the other Eleatics
succeeded in their underlying intention of completely freeing the
abstract mathematical form from the conception of the material which
filled it
 The culmination of this train of thought was to deprive sense-
<p>perception of any contact with reality, and to demand acceptance of
the paradoxical notion that nothing existed save a single undiffer-
entiated entity—spherical (Parmenides) or of infinite magnitude
(Melissus)—which filled all space (though their way of expressing this
was that empty space did not exist), yet was intangible and invisible
and only to be grasped by the intellect. For philosophy to rest there
was impossible. Diogenes fell back on a reaction to earlier Ionian ideas

For those who could not emulate this ostrich-like procedure, there were
only two courses open:
(i) Remaining, as the Eleatics had done, on a single plane of reality,
<p>to abandon monism for a plurality of ultimate physical elements, all
equally real and everlasting, and construct a perceptible cosmos out of
them. This evaded, without refuting, some of the logic of Parmenides,
but respected it to the maximum consistent with preserving and explain-
ing the sensible world.
@ity To admit two grades of reality: the fully existent which was
<p>eternal, unchanging and intelligible as Parmenides had said, and the
shifting world of the senses which could only be the subject of opinion,
not of knowledge or intellection. Though not deserving the name of
Being, it was yet not completely non-existent, but constituted a third
class, not recognized by Parmenides, the world of Becoming, inter-
mediate between Being and Non-being. In this way of escape from
the Parmenidean dilemma lay much of the inspiration of Plato’s
thought.</p>

                               A.   INTRODUCTION'
<p>The study of the Presocratic philosophers has a twofold interest. First,
there are certain broad lines of development to be discerned.    One may
trace, for instance, the progress from a purely hylozoistic ot‘xtlook to
the emergence of a motive element separate from, and acting on, the
rest, carrying with it the gradual separation of the spiritual from the
material and a growing awareness of supersensible reality.                              From a
different angle one may treat this purely as the problem of motion,
investigating the causes leading to, and the consequences lowing from,
Parmenides’s bold denial of its possibility. Another leading motif is
the change of emphasis from matter to form, or from a gualitative to a
quantitative view of the world, in which the Pythagoreans played the
leading     role with       their insistence         on mathematical         pattern     as the
essential element. On the subjective side there is an awakening sensi-
tiveness to the limitations of human knowledge and in particular the
inadequacy of the physical instruments of perception. With this goes
the widening rift between reason and the senses and varying estimates
of the trust to be placed in the latter. Alternatively one may con-
centrate on the methods of early philosophy and investigate its
progress in logical thinking, to which the Eleatics had so much to
contribute.
Secondly, however, the men themselves, as soon as they can be seen
<p>at all through the mists of tradition, stand out as strongly marked
personalities each with an individuality and motives all his own. Itis
this, as much as the development of philosophy to which they contri-
buted, that gives the subject its perennial attraction. It would be
historically false, as well as less interesting, to consider them simply as
links in a chain of intellectual progress. That is why it is best, without

losing sight of themes and problems, to order a history of the period
not problemgeschichtlich but under the names of its outstanding men.
To no one do these observations apply with such force as to Em-~
<p>pedocles. He is indeed unique, one of the most complex and colourful
figures of antiquity, about whom the judgment of critics has at all
times been correspondingly diverse. Philosophically, he had paid
serious attention to Parmenides and endeavoured to rescue the natural
world from Eleatic denial.              Yer he was deeply moved by a mystical
view of the human soul in which he passionately believed, now groan~
ing over its cruel fate as a fallen spirit, now triumphing in the assurance
of his own imminent release from earthly woes and return to the joys
of heaven. Critics are fond of quoting as Renan’s the remark that he
was ‘un Newton doublé d’un Cagliostro’, but this is hardly just cither
to Empedocles or 1o Repan.t When all allowance has been made for
legend, he appears at once as philosopher, mystic, poet, political re-
former and physician, with something of the magician about him and
a corresponding touch of arrogance and showmanship, although some-
times, in relating the sins which involved him in the miseries of earthly
life, he may seem to show an anguished humility. Itis no wonder that
many critics have tended to pick out one or another side of his character
and dismiss the rest as unimportant or unhistorical. But if the combina-
tion seems improbable, we need a scholar like Ktanz to remind us
(however obvious it may sound) that ‘we are in a quite different age
from our own’, the age which Nietzsche called the tragic, and others
have called the lyric or romantic age of Greece. This is the significance
of Empedocles: one of the most remarkable individuals of any period,
  <em> Diels used the phrase to support his theory of two distinct periods in Empedocies’s life,
claiming that it was impassible to he both at once. It might be fairer to compare the celigious side
of Empedocles with Newron’s own interest 10 alchemy and the prophecies of Daniel: he has been
called “the first modem scientist and the Jast of the mages” (Andrade, Sir I. Newzon, 133).
In fact however Renan found in Empedocles much that appealed to his own spirit of rationalism
<p>and liberalism, and few have praised him more highly. ‘Empédocle’, he wrote, ‘ne céde &amp; aucun
de ces génies extraordinaires de Ja philosophie grecque anté-socratique, qui furent les vras
fondateurs de Ia science et de lexplication mécanique de Punivers.’ There follow details of his
scientific achievements, and only then does he 2dd: ‘Par d’autres cotés, ce Newton parait doublé
d'un Cagliostro®, and mention his love of shaw and claims to miraculous powers.
In the 1870s Acragas had by no means forgotten its hero:

he is yet one who could scarcely be imagined in any other society but
his own, the world of the Western Greeks in the early fifth century
B.C. ‘So individualisiert sich seine Zeit in Empedokles.’*
A central problem in the interpretation of his remains arises from
<p>the fact that he wrote two poems, generally considered utterly different
in character. One was given the title On Narure, which links it with
the work of those who were trying to explain the natural world,
according to their lights, on scientific and rational grounds; The other,
called Purificazions, is religious in content and purpose. It describes the
pilgrimage of the spirit, banished by its own fault from tl‘\e realms of
the blessed to which it properly belongs, and doomed tojundergo a
cycle of incarnations in all manner of forms of earthly life; and it reveals
the nature of the primal impurity and the means of expiation and return
to the bliss of immortality.
Many have seen glaring inconsistencies between these two poems.
<p>At the least they are thought to reveal a wholly different spirit and
intention, and many and various explanations have been proposed for
this. They have been assigned to different periods of his life: when he
wrote the second his beliefs and outlook had changed. Thus Bidez
painted a romantic picture of the Purifications as written by a young
man at the height of his powers and flushed with success in politics,
medicine and the arts, addressing his fellow-citizens with the pride and
assurance of an acknowledged and popular leader. Later, sobered by
exile (there is some evidence that he was banished), he turned in soli-
tude to the study of natural science, having presumably seen the folly
of his earlier pretensions to magical or quasi-magical powers. Diels
was equally convinced that the doctrines of On Nazure, which he saw
as “wholly materialistic and atheistic’, could not have been held at the
same time as those of the Purifications; but he completely reversed their
relationship. The Purifications is a later retractation, when the loneliness
of exile had converted its author to a mystical faith. The language of
Otto Kern is even more picturesque: Empedocles ‘experienced his
Damascus’ when in South Italy he came in contact with mystagogues</p>

of the Orphic religious sect. Both these views depend solely on psycho-
logical probability, for there is no external evidence of the relative
dates.?
Another view is that the two poems can well have been contem-
<p>porary, but that Empedocles had, as it were, ‘a religious view for
Sundays and a scientific one for weekdays’. ‘As a rule theology and
natural science exist side by side in his mind quite independently.”
Scholars speak of “ watertight compartments’ between science and faith
in thinkers of this type.3 Similar views are still held. ‘Any attempt to
synthesize his religious and scientific opinions’, writes Dodds, ‘is pre-
cisely what we miss in him.” Vlastos is unequivocal: from his own point
of view as well as ours, the two pictures of reality presented by Em-
pedoacles ‘remain not only heterogeneous but contradictory at crucial
points; they admit of no rational, or, for that matter, even imaginative
harmony.’4
Such critics sometimes adduce as parallels modern scientists who
<p>may be sincere believers in the Christian faith but make little attempt
to bring their religious beliefs into intellectual harmony with what they
have learned in the laboratory. Yer the idea of the conflict between
science and religion, or of the religious-minded scientist who must
forget what he knows in order to retain his beliefs, finds its place more
easily in the nineteenth or twentieth century A.D. than in the lyric age
of Greece. The surprising statement of Burnet, that ‘all through this
period there seems to have been a gulf between men’s religious beliefs,
if they had any, and their cosmological views®, finds little support in
the literature of the time. Indeed it is here above all, in the union of
rational thought with mystical exaltation, that Empedocles sums up and
' No chronological conclusions can be based on the fact that Platarch (De exil. 6o7¢, quoted
<p>by DK with fr. 115) introduces a quotation from the Purifications wita the words &amp; &amp;pxi s

488) that Plutarch meant “at the beginning of Greek philosaphy”. Fr. 131 may concain a refer-
ence, in the Purifications, 1o the poem On Nature, thus showing the latter to have been written
first. See Reinhardt in CP, 1950, 172—4.

personifies the spirit of his age and race. Apollo was Greek and
Dionysus was Greek. It was Greek to say with Pindar, Herodotus
and the tragedians that man must know himself mortal and not seek to
vie with the gods; and it was Greek to say of a dead man ‘God shalt
thou be instead of mortal’. We have perhaps been too long accustomed
to equating ‘ Greek’ with “classical’. Inadmiring the exact proportions,
the pure, formal beauty of the Parthenon (which we see without the
garish colours that once adorned it), we think of its builders as the
people of ‘Nothing too much’; forgetting perhaps that th }very place
where these words were written up was also the scene of the nocturnal
orgia of Bacchus where all restraint was abandoned in thejemotional
purgation of ekstasis and enthusiasmos—'outside oneself” and ‘god in
us’. The Hellenic mind has its romantic as well as its classical aspect,
and both reach a climax without incongruity in the                          genius of this
rematkable Sicilian,
  All this must find justification in the detailed stmdy which follows.
There are two kinds of inconsistencies, those that must have been
obvious to the writer himself and those that strike a scholar as he looks
back from the intellectual level of a different civilization with quite
other beliefs.    Only those of the first kind could necessitate the chrono-
logical hypotheses of a Bidez or a Diels. It was the achievement jn
particular of E. Bignone in his book Empedocle to show that no such
inconsistencies exist.?        Those of the second sort seem glaring at first,
but an imaginative effort, based on knowledge, to recapture the spirit
of the age in which the poems were written may soften even these. If
they do not completely disappear, it will not be surprising. There are
several obstacles to a completely rational explanation of all Empedocles’s
ideas. The first is the fragmentary state of his remains. Next, since he
was poet and mystic as much as philosopher, his system was probably
not completely consistent by the canons of rationalism; moreover the
doxographers, on whom we depend to fill the gaps, were prosaic
individuals who would inevirably distort the poetic elements. Finally,
  <em> For some other scholars who have taken a similar view, see the references given by Verdenius
in Mnemosyne, 1948, p. 10, 1. 9. Perhaps the contribution which showed the most msight

he himself acknowledged more than once the inadequacy of human
faculties to fathom all the secrets of nature.
Apart from actual inconsistencies of thought, some see in the poems
<p>vital differences of temper, mood and purpose. These impressions must
always remain too subjective to be of much value. Thus Kranz, who
has revived the view of Bidez, finds that the poem On Nature ‘bears in
itself the fire of youth’.</p>
</p>
</em> This evidently did not seem so to Diels, and it
is in fact rather strange 1o find more ‘fire’ in this poem than in the
Purifications. For Jaeger, ‘as soon as the first lines of the Katharmoi
[ Purifications] strike our ear, we find ourselves in a realm where a
completely different, mystico-theological style and type of thought
prevail’3 Yet On Nature offers us passages like this:
Ye gods, hallow my lips and draw a pure stream from them, and thou, O
much-wooed,        white-armed       maiden     Muse, in so far as it is lawful for us
creatures of a day to hear, escort me, driving from the house of Piety the
chariot obedient to the reins,</p>
</p>
</p>
</p>
<p>and teaches of Love and Strife as the two forces universally operative
in nature, saying of the one that it is ‘she by whom men think kindly
thoughts and do peaceful acts, calling hier by the names of Joy and
Aphrodite’, and of the ather that when all the elements have been
merged by Love into a single sphere which is divine, then ‘great Strife
is nurtured in its limbs and leaps to its privileges as the time is fulfilled
which is fixed for them in turn by a broad oath’4
Is a “mystico-theological’             style lacking here?             When        intangibles
<p>like this are introduced, rational discussion must fail, and agreement be
despaired of.
Abave all it must never be forgatten that very few of the quotations
<p>are explicitly assigned by our sources to one poem ot the other. Most
of the distribution has been done by modern editors on the basis of

</p>
<p>Although the years of Empedocles’s birth and death cannot be deter-
mined with certainty, the general opinion is well founded that they
must have been approximately 492—32.% That he lived to the age of
sixty has the authority of Aristotle. Apollodorus put hig floruit in
Ol 84 = 444~1, but as he also records that he visited Thurixg‘just after
its foundation® in 445—4, it appears that he is making that his datum
and applying his rule-of-thumb that Empedocles was forty af the time.
He was already politically active in the sixties, and Aristotle’s statement
that he was younger than Anaxagoras is narrowed by Theophrastus to
‘not much younger’. Thete are grounds for dating Anaxagoras’s birth
at about 500.3
Being some            20—25   years younger          than Parmenides,           Empedocles
<p>could easily have been his pupil as later sources say. He evidently
wrote before Melissus (pp. 115{. above), but there is nothing in his
work or Anaxagoras’s to suggest that either knew of the other, and it
is doubtful which had the priority4                     Among his approximate con-

places Aristode rates Anaxagoras’s work the higher. Ross ad foc. thinks Alexander ‘probably
correct”, although the literal sense of Yoepos is “quite possible’. Kahn (Anaximander, 163—5)
has argued strongly for Alexander’s interpretation. He thinks the chronological priority of
Empedocles’s work ruled out because at 984b 15 Aristotle introduces the vols of Anaxagoras as if
it ‘were the first appearance of a motive cause in philosophy, while Empedocles was the first to
coneeive it as double.    I do not think we tan draw such definite chronological conclusions from
Acistatle’s words, particularly as Anaxagoras was in fact the first to make a clean break berween

temporaries were Protagoras the Sophist of Abdera, and at Athens
Pericles and Sophocles, Socrates and Euripides. To some it seems
almost incredible that a figure like Empedocles could have lived in the
heyday of Greek rationalism, enlightenment and scepticism. ‘We
seem’, wrote Freeman the historian of Sicily, ‘to see a man of some
former age, or else a man of some age as yet far distant, brought from
his own world to act along with Pericles and Ephialtes in doing the
practical work of the fifth century before Christ.” To Bignone too he
seemed to belong to another world, the spiritual kin of Epimenides and
Pherecydes, Pythagoras and Onomacritus, men ‘wrapped by legend in
a kind of penumbra of hieratic Oriental wisdom’.* But the atmosphere
of his native Sicily bred such characters more easily than that of Athens.
Only with his younger follower Gorgias of Leontini did the spirit of
scepticism malke itself felt in a Sicilian, and Gorgias was no stranger to
the intellectual circles of mainland Greece.
Anyone who goes to Acragas, the great city that looks down from
<p>its height on the yellow river—so Empedocles himself described it,
and Virgil’s epithet arduus is carefully chosen—must feel pleasure that
so vivid and dramatic a character was born and lived in so appropriate
a setting. From the acropolis the ground falls steeply away, then

words in themselves are not decisive, but that a comparison of doctrine suggests the priority of
Empedocles. With this I agree. Even the one point which Zeller cites as tending in the other
direction, namely that the constitution of mater in Anaxagoras might seem less advanced than
that in Empedacles or the atomists, camot setiously affect anyone who has appreciated the
subtlety and ingenuity of 1he Anaxagorean theory.            On the other hand the direct dependence of
Empedocles on Parmemdes for his premises, which he sometimss repears in Parmenides’s own
wards, is striking. To consider Empedacles before Anaagoras is certinly the logical order.
(Zeller’s discussion of this question on pp. 12614 is still worth reading.) This 1s not to say that
any of the fragments of Anaxagoras can show him to have been dependent on Empedacles.
Gigon (who favours the same view as Kahn) has criticized this claim effectively in Phifologus, 91,

in sheer cliffs of considerable height yet much lower than the summit on
which we are perched. On this ridge, in full view below us, stands the
magnificent line of six great Doric temples, one of them the largest in
the Greek world save only that of Artemis at Ephesus. Religion must
have played a prominent part in the life of the Acragantines. Beyond
the temples lies the sea, and ‘seeing with the mind’ (as Empedocles
bids us) what is beyond reach of our eyes, we are aware of the opposite
coast of Africa, whose            swarthy      inhabitants shared Sicily           with the
Greeks then and for many centuries later, and whose{ proximity
accounts for much in the fiery and unstable character of Sicjly and the
Sicilians. ‘Their cities teem with a mixture of peoples, and tl}ey change
easily from one form of constitution to another.’”             A\
The island was a home of chthonian cults, in which the affinity of
<p>man to his god takes a prominent place. (Cf. vol. 1, 197£.) With its
fertile soil, it was ‘sacred to Demeter and Kore’, and claimed that
‘these goddesses appeared first of all in the island, which was the first
to bring forth grain on account of the goodness of the soil’. At Enna
in the centre of the island was shown the spot where Pluto had risen
up to carry off Kore—Persephone to the underworld, and the torches
which the distracted Demeter carried in her search were lit at the fires
of Etna,<em> In this cult the island claimed priority even over the Eleusinian
mysteries and Athens. It was moteover open to the influence of Orphic
and Pythagorean communities in South Italy, and it seemed appropriate
to Pindar, in warning the tyrant of Acragas of the dangers of success,
to mention the doctrine of transmigration as well as of punishments and
rewards in the hereafter.3
In Empedocles’s boyhood Acragas was at the height of its fame and
<p>power under the rule of the tyrant Theron (488-72). He must have
been only a few years old when Theron with his son-in-law Gelon of
Syracuse defeated the Carthaginians at Himera on the same day (so
Herodotus says) as that other victory of Hellenism over barbarians at

Salamis, The wealth and vigour of the city were advertised in Greece
itself by a series of victories at the great games, for its horses were
famous; but culture was not forgotten and the tyrant was an active
patron of music, poetry and medicine.
Within a year after Theron’s death the tyranny, in the person of his
<p>unworthy son Thrasydaeus, was overthrown, and Acragas became a
no less vigorous and prosperous democracy (Diod. 11.53). In this
political transformation Empedocles played a leading part. He himself
came of a wealthy and aristocratic family, His grandfather had won a
horse-race at Olympia, and his father Meton seems to have been
instrumental in preventing a return of tyranny (D.L. 8.51, 72).
Following in his footsteps Empedocles became a champion of demo-
cracy, and dissolved an oligarchic organization known as the Thousand
(ibid. 66). He is sald to have persuaded the Acragantines to abandon
party strife and cultivate political equality, and for his own part to
have refused the offer of a kingship. But his democratic ideals, and
perhaps also his methods (for some of the stories callected by Diogenes,
even if legendary, suggest at least a reputation for impetuosity), made
enemies. These took advantage of his absence abroad to oppose his
return, and he died an exile in the Peloponnese.?
His visit to Thurii is attested by a contemporary, Glaucus of
<p>Rhegium.®<em> This city, founded on a Panhellenic basis under Athenian
auspices, attracted many famous men, and it is interesting, as Kranz
remarks, to think that there Empedocles could have met intellectual
leaders from all parts of Hellas, men like Protagoras, Herodotus, and
the town-planner Hippodamus. Perhaps more important in relation to
his teaching is the fact that his travels should have taken him to a

</em> This at least is the mast probable of a number of versions of his death (D.L. 8.67). The story
of his leap into Etna, deus tmmortalis haberi dum cupiz (Horace, 4.P, 464), only to be hetrayed by
Ius sandal, perhaps goes back to Heraclides Ponticus (D.L. 8. 6p, Heracl. fr. 85 Wehrh), as does
another more favourable to the divine status to which he in fact laid claim in fr. re2. Aftera
sacrifice he disappeared, and a servant told how in the middle of the night he had heard a great
voice call ‘Empedocles’, and seen an unearthly light; whereupon his disciple Pausanias ordered
that divine honours should be paid to lum (D.L. 8. 67, Herach. 86 W.).
  The offer of kingship is reported by D.L (8.63) from Aristotle, and the authority of Xanthus,
whom Aristotle is quoting, takes it back to Empedocles’s lifetime, On the historicity of chis and
the story of the dowries (D.L. 8.73), see Bignone, Emped. 78 and 82, . 1.

     C.   PERSONALITY:             HEALER         AND     WONDER-WORKER
<p> Of his personal character something has already been said.                            There are
no contemporary accounts, but those of later writers agree well with
the impression gained from his poems. Timaeus remarked (D.L. 8.66)
that his political egalitarianism seemed in strange contrast to the
egotism and boastfulness revealed in his poems. With that went a
certain panache, a love of colour and pageantry. He liked to walk about
with a grave expression, wearing a purple robe with a golden girdle, a
Delphic wreath, shoes of bronze, and a luxuriant growth of hair, and
attended by a train of boys. In his own poems he speaks of himself as
honoured and revered by men and women, among whom he moves
garlanded with ribbons and fresh foliage.?
 Among the gifts which, he says, men and women implored of him
<p>was ‘o hear the word of healing for all sorts of diseases’ (fr. 113.9-10),
and to his pupil he promises to impart knowledge of “all drugs that
exist for ills and old age’ (111.1). His work is pervaded by a keen
interest in the organs of the body and their functions, and later writers
mention him as a doctor and the founder of the Sicilian medical school.
1ts most famous representative, Philistion the contemporary of Plato,
followed Empedoclean doctrine in more than one respect.3 At this
time medicine was not separated either from philosophy on the one hand
* D.L. 8.66 and 63, Athen. 14.6204 (DK, a12). E, Mensching (Favorin, 93) points out that
<p>if the recitotion of Olympia is a fact, the Purifications will belong to Empedocles's later years,
since this was a customary way of making a new work hnown.

or from religion and even magic on the other. ‘ Some’, says Empedocles
in the fragment just quoted, ‘come in search of oracles, others to hear
the word of healing.            .., reminding us that Apollo and Asclepius had
the title Jatromantis, a single compound word meaning ‘physician-
seer’ (Aesch. Suppl. 263, Eum. 62). The author of De vetere medicina
castigates Empedocles, from the point of view of the more empirical
Tonian school, for being of the philosophic type who believe that to
core diseases one must understand nature as a whole. Bur another
Hippocratic treatise, De victu, adopted much the same amalgam of
scientific and religious considerations as he did.</p>
</em>
Although therefore Empedocles may have made serious contribu-
<p>tions tg physiolagy and medical theory, chese are not te be cigidly
separated from his fame as a wonder-worker which has brought to the
lips of many modern critics the word ‘charlatan’. He promises his
pupil not only remedies against ills and old age, but in the same passage
the power to raise the dead, as well as to control the winds and make or
banish rain. Some stories 1old of his prowess will illustrate his reputa-
tion and the difficulty of assessing it. Diogenes (8.70) had read that
the nearby city of Selinus had suffered an epidemic caused by pollution
of their river. Empedocles by diverting two neighbouring streams into
it cleared its waters and stopped the plague. This is a perfectly credible
story, in harmony with his evident interest in the application of science
and technology to the amelioration of human conditions. That the
plague at Selinus was historical is confirmed by contemporary coins.?
Yet because the story ends by saying that the Selinuntines in their

ment each other, and 1n their curious fulness of detarf form a most illuminating commentary an
the dry statement of the ancient biographies of Empedacles’ (Head). W. Fuchs (Mitr. des
Doutsch. Arch. Inst., Rom. Abr. 1956, 115) suggests thar the new temple was dedicated to Hera
Telaia after the city had been purified by Empedocles, in 466. (Some scholars doubt the existence

gratitude honoured Empedocles as a god,! some scholars dismiss it as
an invention arising solely from his own claim to divine status.
He was also reputed to have kept a woman alive for thirry days
<p>without breath or pulse. It is patural to connect this with his claim to
revive the dead,          and    its source,       Heraclides      (see    D.L.    8.61), was
certainly capable of fancy; but some have defended the 1ale as that of a
cataleptic. Another butt for sceptics is the story, as told by Timaeus
(D.L. 8.60), that when the etesian winds were damaging the crops he
had bags made of asses’ skins and stretched our on high poings to carch
the winds. Catching the wind in bags is a magician’s trick well known
from the story of Aeolus in the Odyssey, and the story is sujpected of
having grown out of his own claim in fr. 111 to control them} 1f how-
ever what he erected was a screen or windbreak the device becomes a
practical one, and many have earned a reputation for magic by being a
little ahead of their contemporaries in invention and initiative, Plutarch
indeed says simply that Empedocles walled up a gorge through which
unhealthy winds were blowing.? His study of nature seems to have
had the ulterior aim of controlling her, which he shares with modern
scientists more than with most Greek thought, even though at the
time it was inevitable that in the means employed no distinction
should be made between the natural and the magical. He is fond of
explaining natural phenomena by analogy with human arts and crafts,
speaking in his poems of the mixing of paints (fr. 23) and of dyeing
(fr. 93), comparing the motion of the blood to that of water in a
clepsydra (fr. 100) and the hot springs of volcanic Sicily to artificial
heating systems (Seneca in 468).</p>

teacher of rhetoric (Aristotle called him the inventor of the art, D.L.
8.57), and Gorgias, alsa a Sicilian, was his pupil;* bur unlike his
fellow-islanders Corax and Tisias he is not credited with any treatises
on the subject. No doubt he taught by example rather than precept,
for both his career and some of his poetry support the ancient verdict
that he was an outstanding orator.
Diogenes (8.77) says that the poem on nature and the Purifications
<p>together amcunted to 000 lines. This number should probably be
smaller, as it is likely that the first was contained in two books (rolls),
and the latter in one3 Even so, and although we possess more of the
text of Empedocles than of any other Presocratic philosopher, the
surviving pottion is very small, amounting to no more than 450 lines
in all.
He wrote in the epic tradition, keeping the hexametric metre and to
<p>some extent the language.               But his style has a marked individuality,
and gives the impression that he is not, like Parmenides in the main
part of his wark, farcing hard, dry logic into an alien mould, but using
a medium that comes naturally to him as the best vehicle for his
thought. In the extensive use of similes he follows Homer, but the
similes themselves are practically all drawn from the sphere of human</p>

we have baking, cheesemaking, a wheel, a lantern, the alloying of
metals) and employed to illustrate general laws.? Effective use is made
of condensed or telescoped similes achieved by the transferred use of a
word in a short phrase: he speaks of the harbours of love, the shore of
life, the melting-pots of earth; life is drawn off with a sword and water
cut from a fountain; Aphrodite unites with pegs or dowels of love;
we wear a garment of flesh.&gt; The poetic effect is only heightened when
we know that such phrases can be an imaginative expressijm of what
was to Empedocles a fact, the unity of all living organisms, For him
itis more than metaphor when he speaks of the ear as growirig a sprout
of flesh, of alives bearing eggs, of the sea as the sweat of the earth, of
arms as branches. The underlying thought becomes explicit in a
quotation preserved by Aristotle (fr. 82) in which Empedocles says
that hair, leaves, feathers and scales are <em>the same’. So too since the
first tuen and women grew out of the earth they are called ‘shoots from
the realm of night”. Plutarch showed himself a perceptive critic when
he wrote (Qu. conv. 683, see fr. 148): ‘It is not his habit to decorate
his subject-matter, for the sake of fine writing, with pretty epithets like
bright colours, but rather to make each one the expression of a par-
ticular essence or potency.’
He was impressed with the difficulties of composition with such a
<p>complex theme on his hands, and self-consciously explains his chosen
method. Thijs involved an elaborate interweaving of arguments by
going back on his tracks, putting things in a different way, repeating
lines and half-lines in new contexts. So we have fr. 24, of which the
most probable translation is something like: ‘fitring the heads of my tale
into one another, not to traverse a sole and single path’3                          At 35.1,
using a metaphor from irrigation, he announces: ‘But now 1 shall
return again to the path of song which I set forth before, channelling
off discourse from discourse, thus. ..’, and apain at 17.15: ‘As I said
before when making known the limits of my discourse. . .’, followed

by a repetition of the first two lines of the fragment. ‘It is good’, he
assures us (fr. 25), ‘to say even twice what has to be said’, and one of
his devices is to recall what he has said in one connexion by repeating
a line or half-line in a different context.             Similar repetitions occur in
Homer, but        Empedocles        gives    new    point    to the ancient literary
practice.t
A difference between the two poems appears in the fact that On
<p>Nature is addressed by name to a single person, his favourite pupil
Pausanias: ‘Listen Pausanias, son of wise Anchitus’ (fr. 1). This puts
it in an old tradition of admonitory poetry, of which the best known
examples are Hesiod’s Horks and Days, addressed to his brother, and
the elegiacs of Theognis written for the instruction of Cyrnus. Em-
pedocles goes further than these. In fr. 111, in which he promises that
his pupil will learn the cures for all diseases, have power over the
weather and even conquer death, he states emphatically: ‘For thee
alone will T do this’; and he even enjoins secrecy, ‘in the Pythagorean
manner’ as a speaker in Plutarch says when quoting fr. §: “...to keep
within thy dumb heart.” The seriousness of such an injunction, as with
the Pythagoreans, is hard to assess: Kranz concluded that Pausanias
only gave the poem to the world after bis master’s death,
The Purifications, on the other hand, are almost shouted from the
<p>roofiops. They begin (fr. 112):
Friends, who dwell in the great city looking down on yellow Acragas, on
the heights of the citadel, intent on fine works, honoured refuge of strangers,
unacquainted with want, I give you greeting!
and adjurations in the plural are scattered through the fragments,
contrasting with the second person singular of the other poem. It is
interesting that the personal and confidential form of address is em-
ployed for what we should regard as the more scientific part of his
writings, whereas the rules for a religious life and the doctrine of the
daimon, imprisoned in a series of mortal bodies until it finally wins
purification and freedom, are proclaimed openly to the citizens
of Acragas. This is in keeping with what we know of Pythagorean
tradition, which       contains hints that mathematical               discoveries were

<p>The poem on nature contains several deliberate echoes of                        Parmenides.
Most of these are used to emphasize points of agreement, thugh in one
instance his words are recalled only to be denied. In speaking of an
ultimate plurality, which will make a physical world possible, Em-
pedocles commands his disciple (17.26): ‘Hear thou the undeceiving
order of my discourse’, an obvious echo of Parmenides §.52.¢ He is
no believer in the infallibility of the senses. They are feeble instruments,
but so is the mind (nous), and man can scarcely hope for certainty,
(Fr.2) Narrow are the powers that are spread through the body, and many
the miseries that burst in, blunting thought.&gt; Men behold in their span but
a littde part of life? then swift to die are carvied off and fly away like smoke,
persuaded of one thing only, that which each has chanced on as they are
driven every way; yet each boasts that he has found the whole. So little are
these things to be seen or heard by men, or grasped by the understanding,.
Thou then, since thou hast turned aside to this place,! shalt learn no further
than mortal wit can reach.

</em> The force of these words, presumably addressed to Pausanias, is not obvious: Diels wished
to take them hterally as a reference to the fact that Pausanias is sharing Empedocles’s exile.
Rohde offers an entirely different (and it must be admitted, unlikely) suggestion (Psyche, Eng.
<ol>
<li>406, 1. 96): he helieves the words are addressed to Empedocles himself by the yuyowopmat
Suvépas which are mentioned by Parphyry in connexion with fr. 120, and mean “since you have
strayed to this earth from the soul’s proper abode’. The sense may be quite unexciting—since
you have left others and come to me for instruction’—and the choice of words prompted by the
echo of a Homerdic ending Selpo Awtodns (I/, 22.13). But Rohde’s sense (with the correction
that the words are addressed by Empedocles himself to Pausanias) gives the best connexion
wth the follawing clause: *Since you have come down 1o earth, you cannot go beyond a
mortal’s understanding.”   On the verb see H. Frankel in Antidoron, 275~7. He translates:   ‘Du
hast dich von dem Schwarm der gewohnlichen Menschen abgesondert.”</li>

<p>                                 Echoes of Parmenides
This is reminiscent of the way in which Alcmaeon and Heraclitus
recognized the limitations of human thought (vol. 1, 344, 413). In
spite of it, Parmenides’s outright condemnation of the senses is
countered by the claim that all alike are aids to knowledge and none is
to be preferred.
(Fr. 3.9)       Come now, observe with all thy powers how each thing is clear,
neither holding sight in greater trust compared with hearing, nor noisy
hearing above what the tongue makes plain, nor withhold trust from any
of the other limbs [organs, parts of the body], by whatever way there is a
channel to understanding, but grasp each thing in the way in which it is
clear.
 More commonly however the language of Parmenides is recalled
<p>to show how far Empedocles is prepared to go with him. He accepts
the statements that nothing can come out of nothing and that what
exists cannot perish; the sum of being is constant.
(Frr. 11 and 12) Fools—for they have no far-reaching thoughts, who sup-
pose that what formerly was not can come into being or that anything can
die and perish wholly.         For there is no means whereby anything could come
to be out of what in no way is, and it cannot be brought about or heard of?
that what is should perish. Wherever one may thrust it, there it will always
be.
We have also (fr. 17.32£):
But what could increase this All?               Whence could it come? And how also
could jt perish, since nothing is empty of these things?
The last words hint at the denial of void, which is more explicit in
frr. 13
Nor is any part of the All empty nor yet overflowing,
and 14
Of the All, none is empty ; whence then could anything enter it?
  <em> Contrast Parm. 7.3ff. Other interpretations of these lines, claiming to see in them an anti-
thesis between reason and the senses, are mentioned by Millerd, Emped. 25, n. 2. Karsten’s

<p>                                         Empedocles
So far Parmenidean logic is inescapable. What is real cannot come
<p>to be or perish, and it is everywhere, since to admit emptiness is to
concede the reality of what is not. But from this Parmenides had
deduced two further conclusions—that reality was a unity and that it
was immovable—which Empedocles did not find so compelling. By
denying them, the more fundamental principles might be observed,
without taking away all reality from the physical, perceptible world.
(Fr.8) I shall tell thee another thing: there is no birth o¥ any mortal
things, nor any end in baneful death, but only mingling and feparation of
what is mingled; birth is the pame given to these by men.”
Parmenides was right in denying that a plurality could evez, be derived
from an ultimate unity; but what if there was no ultimate unity, but a
plurality of primary entities which had always existed? 1t is time to
give up the tenet on which all cosmogony and cosmology had hitherto
been openly or tacitly based, but which had been shown by Parmenides
10 lead logically ta the abolition of cosmogony and the annihilation of
phenomena: that is, the ultimate unity of all that exists. The new order
is announced in fr. 6 (which is cited by Tzewzes as being from the first
book ‘On Nature’):

(314b5) he interprets this very fragment 1n that way. Unfortunarely he seems 1o have changed
his mmd, and in the ‘philosophical dicuonary” of Meraph. &amp;, where he rnumerates different
senses of the word, he quotes the same fragment to illustrate giaisas meaniag A v         puoe Svrwv

are always dying. He therefore took oUBt. . . avérroio TeheuTs) o mean ‘there is na end of death’,

and 6. v8hos in I, 3.309; also Mimnermus 2.6~ Diehl,
Since Aristotle interprets the word both ways, his evidence must be discaunted, but all other
<p>Greek tesumony goes to confirm the interpretarion that he gives in Gen. et corr. Plutarch writes

an implied rebuke. Genesis and death are only names for the process of mingling and separation
of certain elements. Only Plutarch’s interpretation makes good sense of the passage.

<p>                                     The Four Roots
Hear first the four roots of all things:               bright    Zeus, life-bringing Hera,
Aidoneus, and Nestis who with her tears makes springs well up for moreals.”
The divine names here accorded to the elements are replaced elsewhere
by plain language:
(¥Fr. 17.18)      Fire and water and earth and the immeasurable height of air.
Indeed Empedocles has no fixed terminology, a fact of which the
<p>exigencies of metre prabably offer no more than a partial explanation,
the rest being the demand of the poetic imagination for concrete visual
images. Fire appears also as flame and Sun (both Helios and Elektor
the shining one, ¢f. J/. 6.513), water as rain and sea (both 6éAaoco and
TévTos), air as sky (Ouranos). (The Greek dtles are listed in Gilbert,
Mer. Theor. 107, n. 3.)
Aristatle says (Meeaph. 985a31) that Empedocles was the fisst 10
<p>speak of four materia] elements, and his originality in this respect is
usually granted without question. It is perhaps difficult to determine
priority between him and the Pythagoreans, who certainly must have
recognized the four efements before the end of the fifth century. (Cf.
vol. 1, 266f.) Pythagorean influence on Empedocles was strong, as
appears from the importance which he assigus to transmigration and
abstention from flesh and beans; and it is noteworthy that he gives to
his elements, as the source of all nature, the titles which the ancient
Pythagorean oath applies to the tetractys. It *contains the springs and
root of everlasting nature’,? and Empedocles calls the elements now
the ‘roots of everything” and now the ‘spring of mortal things’. 1t
also became clear in our examination of earlier thoughr (vol. 1, 5221,
313) that the conception of four primitive forms of matter was arrived
at gradually rather than by a sudden inspiration. Tts beginnings are in
myth, and may be seen in the division of the universe in Homer (/.
<ol>
<li>189 f1.) whereby the heavens fell to the lot of Zeus, the sea to Posei-
don, and the misty darkness to Hades, while the earth was held by them
all in common. From the earliest times it seemed to the Greeks that

<p>                                          Empedocles
the components of the world fell naturally into four main categories or
states, whether one call them qualities or substances. The first philoso-
phers had spoken of it as made up of the hot, the cold, the wet and the
dry, or of substances in which these opposites manifest themselves:
 earth, water, air and fire. Heraclitus mentioned all four, in a passage
 which is only rejected by scholars on the ground of their own (prime
Jfacie improbable) belief that he did not recognize air (or rather aer,
 mist or vapour) as one of the main constituents of the world.t
 1f however one looks at Aristotle’s mention of the four    Empedoclean
<p>elements at a slightly earlier point in his account (98428),i it appears
probable that the novelty with which he credits him is &amp;omething
slightly different and less disputable. With him for the first time the
four take the rank of genuine archai: none is prior to any other, nor is
there anyhing else more fundamental.                      Heraclitus may have mentioned
them all, but he exalted the priority of fire; Thales and Anaximenes had
promoted water and ait respectively to be sole arche generating the
rest; for Anaximander they came out of the apeiron, and for the Pytha-
goreans they were the final product of the One. All these rival claims
had been made obsolete by the insistence of Parmenides that no unity
can ever generate a plurality. Only by a plurality of equal and wltimate
archai or elements can the phenomena be saved. Hence ‘all these are
equal and coeval, bur each is master in a different province and each
has its own character’ (fr. 17.27f). They are like Anaximander’s
opposites given an explicitly substantial character and with no apeiron
behind them.<em>
  </em> Cf.vol 1, 453 with n. 2.
  <em> Thoungh standing mainly in the Italian tradition, Empedocles, it seems ohvious, owed much
to reflexion on the Milesian schemes. Suggesting that the four “roots’ aze 2 development of the
‘opposites” hot, cold, wet and dry, Reinbardt {Parm. 227) saw them a5 an extensian of medical
theory, especially that of Alemaeon: the opposites that work in the human body (Alemaeon fr. 4;
see vol. 1, 346) have been extended to the whole of nature. This was also the opinion of Tannery,
Gomperz and others. Millerd (Emped. 33) is eritical of the idea that </em>abstract qualities® like hot
and cold could have furnished the origin of the theary.      It would indeed be questionable if &amp;
Ocpuov, T wuxpby, etc., had ever been regarded as ‘abstract qualives’, but this is surely not so.
(Cf.vol.1,79.) In any case the origins of 2 major doctrine like tns are complex, We may suppose
that Milesian monism, Western medical theory, the compnlsion to answer Parmenides, and the
philosopher’s own pawers of observation all played their part.
  Gomperz's note (Gr. Th. 1, 5581.) that the four elements occur in Hindu popular thought may
incline one 10 suppose thar they represent a universal human way of loching at the world. But o
the Chinese it seemed equally natural to speak of five elements: fire, water, earth, wood      and
metal (Needharm, Science and Civilisation, 11, 232f5.).

<p>                           The Roots are True Elements
Although this doctrine of the four elements was dethroned im-
<p>mediately by Anaxagoras and the atomists, in a modified form it was
testored as the basis of physical theory by Aristotle, whose tremendous
anthority supported it throngh and beyond the Middle Ages. In spite
of the challenge of chemists like Boyle, it would commonly have been
said even in the eighteenth century that the elements of bodies were
earth, water, air and fire.<em> The change introduced by Aristotle was to
suppose the elements capable of mutual transformation.</em> The theory of
Plato’s Tirmaeus also demanded this, but on a mathematical basis which
in Aristotle’s eyes was fanciful. Moreover for neither of these two were
the ‘elements’ strictly elemental. Plato said that far from being letters,
they were even more complex than syllables. They were only the most
elementary form of percepuihle substance. Behind them stood for Plato,
with his Pythagorean ardour, the world of numbers and geometry, and
for Aristotle ‘ prime matter’ as a logically necessary postulate of change,
though iraperceptible and incapable of an existence unqualified by form.
The divine names given o the elements are not mere poetical
<p>ornaments. The way in which they are acted upon, as will appear later
(pp. 1561.), shows them to be sentient. Indeed Empedocles carries
the notion of the kinship of all nature so far as to say that nothing is
without sense (frr. 103, 170.10). Being both sentient and everlasting,
they are immortal, and so divine. <em> The elements too are gods’, reports
Aristotle, and later the doxographers repeat that both the elements and
their mixture (that is, the complete mixture in the Sphairos under the
rule of Love) are gods.3 Hylozoism may be modified, but its complete
eradication is a gradual process, for its roats are old and deep, not only
in previous philosophy but also in religion; and Empedocies, for all
his intellectual gifts, was the reverse of irreligious.
7 Thus J. F. Gmelin wrote, in his Zinfeitung in die Chemic of 1780, that we have 
</em>very gaod
reason to allow the name of elements to fire, water, air and earth, if we imagine them in their
greatest putity”.   (Quated by F. A. Paneth in Brit. Jaurn. for Philos. of Sci. 19623, 146.)

                          Additional Notes
<p>(1) The divine names of the elements (p. 141)
The distribution of the divine names between the four elements has
<p>been in doubt since antiquity. (Fire is referred to less equivocally as
Hephaestus in fir. 96 and 98.) Nestis alone is undisputed. She is
obviously water, and the choice of such an obscure figure is explained
when we learn from Photius that she was a Sicilian deity (Bignone,
542, n. 3). This Sicilian water-goddess cannot ‘disappea} from the
scene’ so easily as Kranz supposed (Hermes, 1912, 23, n. 1). \According
to him she is simply a personification of sobriety or temperance
(Vichternheir), and the word, as he says, occurs as early as Homer.
There however it means ‘fasting’, as also in Aeschylus.     Kranz seems
to be thinking along the same lines as Hippolytus (433), who explains
that water is the vehicle of nourishment without being itself nourishing ;
but the etymological connexion with vioTis = fasting is not un-
challenged. Bignone (542, n. 3) considered a more watery derivation
(from vadew, cf. viiocos), which had already been put forward by
Simplictus (De an. 68.14), 10 be evidente. (See also ZN, o049, n. 1.)
Moreover this ‘ G&amp;ttin Niichternheit” is otherwise unheard-of; and it
seems unlikely that Empedocles would put a new personification of his
own alongside of popular gods like Zeus, Hera and Aidoneus.
Aidoneus, for Homer onwards an alternative form for Hades god of
<p>the underworld and the dead, w ould most naturally seem to represent
the earth. So Aétius (4 33) and most modern writers (e.g. Zeller, Diels,
Bignone, Millerd). But Diogenes Laertius (8.76) identifies him with
air, as do Stobaeus and Hippolytus. (See 433.) The name means
‘invisible’, and Hippolytus argues that we see everything through air
but cannot see air itself. Diels however (Dox. 8p, and see Burnet,
EGP, 229, n. 3) showed convincingly that whereas Aétius represents
the soberer tradition going back to Theophrastus, the others are based
on a school of Homeric allegorists trying to reconcile Empedocles
with Homer.      Knatz in 1891 propounded the novel view that
Aidoneus was fire, explaining the association of fire with the god
of the underworld    by reference to Sicilian volcanoes. This has no
ancient authority, and in spite of the support of Thiele and Burnet
                                f44
<p>                   Divine Names of the Elements
(see £GP, 229, n. 3) is adequately refuted by Bignone (Emped. 543)
and Millerd (31).
  By Zeus all ancient authorities are agreed that Empedocles meant
<p>fire. Diogenes Laertius and Hippolytus call him mip, and Aétius (433)
equates wlp with Thv zéow xad v oifépa. The latter phrase is
repeated without mUp in Stobaeus, and could lead to confusion because
whereas for these later writers oi87p was equated with fire, in Empedocles
himselfit 15 an alternative pame for air. (Cf. especially frr. 98, 100. 5,
71.2,109,als0 115.9~11. Fora possible reason for this see the quotation
from Wightman on p. 225 below, and for the apparent exception in
fr. 38.3-4 see p. 185, n. on ».3,)    Nevertheless, no scholars have tried
to equate Zeus with air save those who, by allowing Aidoneus to ususp
the place of fire, had put themselves under the necessity of finding
another function for him. In the more philosophical poets like Euri-
pides, who equated the gods with parts or aspects of the natural world,
Zeus is spoken of as the fiery «i8p of the upper heavens, beyond the
dimmer spaces of &amp;p.      Empedocles doubtless had the same thought in
mind.
The epithet geptopios, life-bringing, applied to Hera immediately
<p>suggests the fruitful earth (yaia), which it describes in Hes. 7%. 693
and Hom. Hymn Apollo, 341. Burnet remarked that it seemed only to be
used of earth and corn. The epic associations led Diels to suppose that
this identification too (made by Diagenes Laertius (8. 76), Stobacus and
Hippolytus, 4 33) was an error of the Homerists, but since Empedocles
himself stood in the epic tradition the argument does not here seem so
strong. It is also hkely that Hera was, at least in origin, an earth-goddess
(Guthrie, Gks. and their Gods, 681.), though that may well have been
fargotten by this time. The identification with earth is followed by
Knatz, Thiele, Burnet and Kranz. On the other hand A&amp;tius (433) sup-
posed that Hera is here the air, and this opinion has been held in modern
tmes by e.g. Diels, Zeller, Bignone, Millerd. (See the arguments of
Bignone, §43f) It is true enough that ‘life-bringing’ is a highly
appropriate epithet for the air we breathe, though doubrful whether
this would have weighed more with Empedocles than poetic precedent.
Snell ( Philol. 1943, 1591.) argues from this epithet that Hera i3 the earth,
and for Aidoneus as &amp;ip compares the epic Téprapov RepodvTa, etc.

   1f one must decide, it is perhaps safest to follow the Theophrastean
<p>tradition with Bignone and say that Zeus = fire, Hera = air, Nestis =
water and Ajdoneus = earth. Fortunately the question is of little
importance for Empedocles’s thought. It does however raise points of
some interest for the history of Greek philosophical religion, and this
note may serve as a starting-point for anyone who wishes to follow
them up. Cf. also O. Gilbert’s note, Mez. Theor. 110, n. 2.
(2)    The immutable elenents and fr. 26.2 (p. 143)
The remains of Empedocles himself, as well as Aristotle’sicommens,
<p>leave no doubt that he conceived of the elements as immmutable and
wndestructible. This was one of the cornerstones of his jnswer to
Parmenides. But mention should be made of a difficulty which has
been felt in connexion with the first two lines of fr, 26, which run:
          v B¢ téper kpaTEOUTT TTEPITTAGLEVOLD KUKAOIO
           Kad @Bivel els SAANAC vad alferan &amp;v péper aioms.
<p>Simplicius quotes this fragment as coming <em>a little after’ fr. 21, and
intends us to suppose that the subject is still the four elements. In any
case much of the fragment is repetition of parts of fr. 17. Verse 1 =
17.29 (with the variant xixhoio for xpévoio) and v, §-6, 8~12 practi-
cally reproduce 17.7~13. And in fr. 17itis quite clear that the elements
are in question, or possibly in the latter part of the fragment the elements
plus Love and Strife. These latter, however, can hardly be included here
in view of »v. 5-6.
Simplicius (Phys. 160.14) thought that in vv. 1—2 Empedocles was
<p>asserting the muiual ransformation of the elements, and in modern
times too they have commonly been translated in some such way as:</p>
</em> They perish into each other and grow out of (or originate from) each
other.” Bignone (Emped. 5331f) avaids the difficulty by supposing
that Empedocles is here making a concession to ordinary language as

argument of Verdenius (Mnemos. 1948, 12£.) that in fr. g he is speaking
of the so-~called birth and death of mortal crearures like animals and
birds: he would not allow himself this language in speaking of the

These words do not mean ‘perish’ or “decline” and ‘come into being”:
they mean ‘grow smaller’ and ‘grow larger’. Plato and Aristotle were
not inventing new technical uses when they distinguished o€neis and
gbicis both from ytveais and pfopd and from &amp;GAhoicosts. The sum total
of each element is of course constant as are its qualides and functions
(figos and i,          fr. 17.28); but in any particular part of the cosmos

surely untenable, and ‘dwindle into one another’ is not an impossibly

Inall this they are, as it were, the Parmenidean One multiplied by four,
butin other respects they depart from thatnorm. Although Empedocles
accepted the Eleatic denial of empty space, he did not admit as a neces-

‘beings’ take on two characteristics denied by Parmenides to his single
Being, which make the genesis of a cosmos possible: they are (a) in
motion and (&amp;) divisible. The latrer is illustrated by fr. 22.1-2: ‘For
all of these—sun, earth, sky and sea—are at one with their own parts
which are scartered far from them in mortal things.” The divisibility
and movement of the four ‘roots’ make jt possible that ‘there is no
birth or death of mortal things, but only mingling and separation of
what is mingled’. Apparent change is only rearrangement. i There are
just these elements’, he writes, ‘but by running through oge another
they alter cheir appearance: so far does mixture effect changg’ (2r. 13~
14). Immediately after these lines Simplicius goes on to fuote the
picturesque simile of the painter’s palette with which Erhpedocles
illustrated the production of infinite variety our of the same few
elements (fr. 23, Simpl. Phys. 160):
As when painters ate decorating votive tablets, men well skilled and cunning
in their craft, they take the various pigments in their hands, mixing in due
adjustment more of these and less of those, and produce from them forms
resembling all things, creating trees, men, women, beasts, birds and fishes

let not the falsehood subdue thy mind that chere is any other source [i.e.
than the elements of all the countless martal things thar are plain to see.
The simile gains additional precision from the fact that Greek painters
worked in terms of four basic colours (white, black, yellow, red), the
same in number as the elements.?
of water). The importance of the idea that 1n a plenum circular or vortex-like mation {s possible
{"peas can move with the vortices of pea-soup’) has been emphiasized by K. R, Popper. Credit-
ing st to Plato (though at must surely have been already in the mind of Empedocles) he writes
(Brit. Journ, for Philos. of Sci. 1952, 147, n. 1): ‘Plato’s reconcibation and the theory of the
plenum (“nature abhors a vacuum™) became of the greatest importance for the hustory of physics
down 10 our own day. For i1 influenced Descartes strongly, became the basis of the theory of
ether and light, and thus ulnmately, via Huyghens and Maxwell, of de Broglie's and Schrodinger’s
wave-mechanics.” (See also idemn, Cony. and Ref. 81,1, 22. For the ‘circular thrust’ in Plato, see
Tém. 8ac w&amp; Bt kevdv elval pably Teplel BE quta Talrra els EAARAG, KTA.)
¥ Democritus recognized these four colours as ‘simple’ (Theophir. De sens. 73, DK, 68 A135,
<p>P- 445 below), and ps.-Aristatle De mundo, 396b12 says 1t 15 by nuang these four that painters
gain their effects. That Empedocles noted an acwal correspondence between the colours and the
elements is stated by Aetws (1.14.3, A92), though Theopheastus criticizes him for allowing only
for black and white in his explanation of the sense of sight. The eye is composed of fire (white)
and water (black). How then, asks Theophrastus, if like is percerved by like, do we perceive
mixed colours like grey? (De sens. 17, 486). He does not, as one might expect, raise the question
in zelation to the other two ‘simple’ colours, which leaves one iy some doubt whether Aétius was

<p>             Mixture and the Particulare Theory of Matter
It is not immediately obvious whether Empedocles was imagining
<p>matter as continuous and flowing or as made up of minute discrete
paticles; but without a particulate structure of matter it is difficult to
picture the movements taking place as he describes them, and this was
attributed to him in larer antiquity from Aristotle onwards. Aristode
writes (Gen. et corr. 334a26):
What is cthe manner of change according to those who follow Empedocles?
Tt must be like the putting together of a wall out of bricks and stones. Their
‘mixture’ must be of elements which persist, bur are combined in small
particles lying side by side.” In this way arise flesh and everything else.
So also, some centuries later, Galen (DX, 443, and cf. 43.):
Empedocles too says that we and all other terrestrial bodies are made out of
the same elements as Hippocrates names, not however fully blended with each
other but lying beside and in contact with each other in small particles (pépia).
Theophrastus (De sens. 115 DK, 486) had spoken of the nature of men
in whom the elements are ‘close-packed and broken up fine’<em> The
doxographers          describe       these      particles in language             suggestive        of
the atomists Leucippus and Democritus: ‘Empedocles said that
prior to the four elements were minimum particles (8pavonaTs),
right to say that Empedocles recogmzed all four.        (Cf. Daels, Dox. 222,   Aét. 1.15.7 attributes
four primary colours to Pythagorean theory also.) Certatnly Theophrastus attributes them
expheidy to na one hefore Democritus, but it is dafficuly to beheve that the writer of fr. 23 did
not have the four in muind.

homoeomerous and as it were elements before the elements’, and: ‘He
constructs the elements out of smaller bodies (8yxor), whichare the least
of all and as it were elements of the elements.’” This may mean no more
than that, for example, earth is an element but is composed of millions of
minimum particles, each of which has all the properties of earth. If
‘elements of the elements’ means anything more, it is certainly wrong.
Empedocles himself is emphatic that nothing must be thought of as prior
to the ‘four roots’ with their inherent qualitative differences, Here he
differs fundamentally from the atomists, who taught that the elements of
everything are atomic bodies lacking all the sensible qualities (colours,
sounds, flavours, smells) later to be known as ‘secondary’. These
resulted from the interaction of atoms from outside with those in our
own bodies and were therefore subjective and arbitrary. Nevertheless
the doxographers could scarcely have said what they did had there
not been in Empedocles                some evidence of ‘least particles’ such as
Aristotle provides.?
The notion of the elements ‘running through one another’ was made
<p>more precise by the theory that they and their compounds contained
microscopic (Arist. Gen. et corr. 324b30)                    passages or pores which
might or might not admit the particles of other substances. It is most
fully described in connexion with sensation (pp. 231 f. below), but
was also used to explain why some substances combined mote easily
  ¥ Aet. 1. 13. 1 and 1. 27. 3 (DK, a43).   J: would nor be unlike the doxographers, with their
unsubtle approach and zeal for conformiry, to assimilate Empedocles’s theory to the atomic,
and if they did, itis possible to guess at the origin of this mistake. Asclepiades of Bithynia, a
medical writer of the first century B.c., adopted a form of atomism based on that of Heraclides
Pondicus. Both called their atoms 8yxor. Like the atoms of Democrims and Epicurus, they had
no sensible quabties, yet Sextus (Pyrrk, hyp. 3.33) wrote of wois Tepl "AoKAnT&amp;dNY. | . 8poar
dhvat T&amp; oToisia Myovor kai ok, (CF. pavsiara of Empedacles above.) The most reasonable
explanation of this is given by Bacumker in Problem d. Materie, 326 n. By ovoixsia here Sextus
means, not the dykal themselves, but the elements in the Empedoclean sense——earth, water, etc.
For Asclepiades the Syxor are croiygia mps 16v ovoxslwy    Now Ascleprades in his theories also
made great use of wopor. We read for instunce korrds wov <em>Aaidnmidbny oToiysia &amp;vBpdiov Sykoy
Spavaol kal mépor. (Ps,-Galen 14.698 Kuha: whether he actually thoughe of the dywor as
Spoucol, and so not strictly atoms, is beside the present argument.) As Baeumker points out,
the physical basis of Asclepiades’s    theories goes back not only to the atomists    but also to
Empedocles, and the confusion in the doxographic accoum probably owes something to this
later combination of the two types of theory.

</em> Admittedly Aristotle’s expression shows that he could find no explicit statement in Empe-
dacles that the elements existed in the form of minimum particles. He was inferring from what he
did find that Empedocles pictured them to humself in thus way, and the balance of the evidence
suggests that he was right. See also p. 1§2.</p>

than others, for example water with wine but not with oil (fr. 91 and
Theophr. De sensu, 12): it was a question of having ‘pores’ of the
right gauge. ‘ Those substances can mingle whose pores are reciprocally
symmetrical’ (Arist. Gen. et corr, 3241 34), or in Theophrastus’s words,
‘he accounts for mixture in general by symmetry of pores’ (De sensu,
 12).} Everything is continually giving off films or ‘effluences’. A line
of Empedocles on this subject has been preserved by Plutarch (Qu.
nat. 916d, fr. 89):
Look at it in the light of Empedocles,
 ‘ Perceiving that there are effluences from all things that have come into
  being’.
<p>Not only from animals and plants, or earth and sea, but also from stones,
bronze and iron there is a continual and abundant outflow. Indeed it is this
unbroken flux and movement which causes the destruction and perishing of
everything.<em>
The doctrine is referred 10 by Plato (Meno, 76¢), and Theophrastus
confirms (De sensu, 20) that Empedocles invoked it as a cause of perish-
ing or wasting away. ‘If’, he writes, ‘wasting is caused by effluence,
and scent also is a matter of effluence, things with the strongest scent
ought to pass away the guickest.” His further criticism, that when
Love is gaining there could be litte or no sense-perception because
objects would be drawing matter in, not sending it out, confirms what
one would expect, that these effluences in our own world are due to the
separating action of Strife. The actual entering of one hody into another,
through the pores, is according to Aristotle Empedocles’s explanation
of all action and passion in the physical world.
  </em> Other examples: white particles fit the fire-peror of the eye, black panicles the water-poroi
(Theophr. De sensu 7; DK, 486); films given off by iron press into the porof of the lodestane
(Alex., 480); nourishment from the earth fits the poroi of plants (Plut., see fr. 77).
‘Whether Empedocles himself nsed the word wépat in this connexion is doubtful. In the sur-
<p>viving fragments we find various poetic £quivalents, x6avor or Yo&amp;van in frr. 8.4.9 (as restored by

  Aristotle was quick to point our the difficulty of reconciling this
<p>theory with the denial of void. His point that if the pores are full they
 are a superfluous hypothesis (Gen. er corr. 326b8) is, as a general
 criticism, captious, but in connexion with sensation they lead to serious
difiiculties which Empedocles does not seem to have faced. At present
we mnay note simply that on this theory the elements must be constructed
of parts which are never divided beyond a certain point, as otherwise
everything could be fitted into everything else and there could be no
question of an ‘asymmetry’ of pores. This 100 might be 4 consequence
that he had not fully thought out, were it not for the positive evidence
that he did regard matter as particulate in this way. Thatlhe was, seen
through later eyes, a forerunner of the atomists without fully reaching
their position is further borne out by Aristotle’s remark (De caelo,
305232) that he ‘seems to mean” that the smallest body is divisible but
will never be divided’.               His particles remained physically intact al-
though he had not advanced to the notion of theoretically indivisible
magnitudes.t It is not surprising if the compilers of doxographies
took him the whole way. He did in fact provide atomism with three
of its fundamental tenets: the ideas of indestructible elements
and smallest particles, and the reduction of all forms of change to
mechanical mixture. They further took over and developed the theory
that physical objects were constantly giving off films or ‘effluences’
(fr. 89) of microscopic particles, and used it as he did 1o explain sensa-
tion.?

easier reading. (There is a similar variation berween éwovra and &amp;xacein Simphicius’s six citations
of v. 7. See DK ad loc.)
Bignone was influenced by his assumprion thae Empedocles was describing the Sphairos, or
<p>universe under the supremacy of Lave, but he is not here considering any single episode in the
casmic cycle: he is at the earhier stage of sering out the factors involved and describing what hap-
pens n general terms, as v». 78, 16-17 and 29 make clear. I therefore attach no temporal signi-
ficance to the fact that Strife is ‘apart from these’ and Love ‘amang them’. It will simply be the
ethos {v. 28) of Serife to shun others, as it is of Love to embrace them. It must be remembered

Panzerbieter’s wet’ Saoew. Pfligersdorfler (Poseidonios, 110, n. 2) has an original notien of
the meaning of this line: no man has seen Love cirching round, because in fact she does not; a
whirling motion would be most unswieable for her! The point 1s that whereas everyone recog-
nizes the power of Love in human afairs, her cosmic significance has been missed.
. 30 emphasizes the Parmenidean truth thac since the elements and Love and Strife are ever-
<p>lasting and are the only realities, nothing ever (in the strict sense) comes into being or perishes at
all. It does not of course imply that they themselves come into being or perish. For this reason
some translate the last half ‘nor do zhey perish’, but this is unnecessary and the change of subject
is harsh.

Verse 29 = fr. 26, 1. Verse 34 recurs in different contexts as 26. 3 and

some things and now others and yet ever and always the same’ we
have at 26. 3 ‘become men and the other kinds of animal’, and the lines
which appear in this fragment as 7~8 are added immediately after as
part of the same sentence, and followed by a further subordinate clause.
At 21.13 the following line is ‘ become different; so much does mixture

<p>  The problem of motion was not solved by positing four elements
instead of one. Parmenides had insisted that what exists could not
move, and had made impossible the unreflecting hylozoism which had
enabled earlier philosophers to avoid the question of a motive cause.
Since the elements were to be as like the Parmenidean One as possible,
Empedocles felt bound to introduce external motivators. Some have
thought that this eliminates any idea of life, and brings us to the con-
ception of inanimate bodies moved purely mechanically by external
forces. Thus Cornford wrote:
Though the elements are called gods (because immortal) and given mythical
names, they are not alive. As the conception of a bodily element grows
clearer, the life is frozen out of it. The living force of motion is deposited
by Empedocles in distinct substances.”
What these movers were we learn in this fragment. They too have
<p>‘mythical’ names, Strife and Aphrodite or Love, the powers of repul-
sion and attraction. Since their effects are contrary, and both are active
together, they represent something very like the simultaneous opposite
tensions, the ‘hidden harmony’ of Heraclitus. As in Heraclitus also,
it is only while the struggle between the contrary forces continues that
a world of living creatures can exist:<em> the preponderance of either leads
to the break-up of the cosmos and a state in which terrestrial life is
impossible. Since both are active and opposed, the elements can never

be permanently in a state of mixture or separation, but alternate between
the two, and at some paint in either process a world of mortal creatures
can be born. We notice already an advance in elasticity of language
from the uncompromising ‘It is or it is not’ of Parmenides. Much
later Aristotle was to say ‘“Being” is a word used in several senses’,
and patiently analyse and dissect it. That time is not yet, but the first
step has been raken when Empedocles can write (»v. 9ff.) “In some way
[ie. in so far as different compounds are produced and resglved by the
motions of the elements] things do come to be and petish, but in
another [i.e. in so far as the moving elements are indestructble and un-~
alterable in themselves] they are for ever.” He cannot avdid the lan-
guage of becoming—he must say for instance that the elements ‘ becorme
now some things and now others’~—but with remarkable awareness he
has warned his readers of this (fr. 9): when the elements combine to
form animals or plants, men say these are born, and when they scatter
again men call it death, “wrongly, but Lcomply with? custom myself’.
Love and Strife are of course everlasting like the elements: ‘ Never will
boundless time be emptied of these two’ (fr. 16).
 The contrary effects of Love and Strife may also be expressed by
<p>saying that Love represents attraction between dissimilars and Strife
the attraction of like to like. The tendency of Strife to pull the elements
apart from each other has as its natural corollary the gathering of each
one togerher in a separate mass.               Aristotle puts this clearly, though in
his readiness to find fault with a predecessor he imputes to Empedocles
an unreal inconsistency. ‘At any rate’, he writes (Meraph. 985a23),
“in many places his Love divides and Strife unites, When the whole is
separated into the elements by Strife, fire and each of the others is
collected into one; and when again under the action of Love they come
together into one, it is necessary for the parts from each element to be
separated once more.’
What fr. 17 says of the nature and working of the two forces,
<p>especially Love, is confirmed elsewhere, and casts serious doubts on
the view that Empedocles has at last achieved the distinction between
* For tuignin I have borrowed the word used by Locke in speaking of secondary qualities,

inert matter and mechanical force.               Love turns out to be no mythical
name for an impersonal physical force attracting inanimate hodies ro
aue another in the manner of magnetism or gravity.                      She is Aphrodite,
the same power which men feel in their own hearts, filling them with
thoughts of peace and lovingkindness, as Strife (or Anger as it is
called in 21.7) induces hatred.            In fr. 22 the elements are ‘dear to one
another’ when Aphrodite unites them, and become hostile and grim by
the bidding of Strife. In fr. 21 they come together in Love and ‘are
desired by one another’. Microcosm and macrocosm are governed by
the same psychological principles. Empedocles has at last separated
mover and moved, but we are not in the world of Descartes or New-
ton.!    Indeed, for his forces to be mechanical, psychologically and
morally neutral, would not have suited him, for he had also a religious
message t0 preach, the message of the Purificarions, and both were
based on a single world-view.            Some aspects of the physical world may
incline one to forget this, but his own words confirm the dictum of
Axistotle (Metaph. 985 a 4) that if one follows his meaning rather than
his imperfect expression one will say that Love is the cause of good
and Strife of evil. He presents a combiation of physical and moral
dualism unique in history, for at no other moment would it have been
possible.
Another characteristic of these powers is equally disturbing to the
<p>mind of a later age. Aristotle, with his own clear-cut classification in
mind, complained (Meraph. 1o75b2) that in Love Empedocles con-~
fused the final, formal and material causes. Itwas ‘the good’,and at the
same time ‘both moving                principle—for it combines               things—and
matter, for it is a part of the mixture’. Existence was still tied to exten-
sion in space, and so we read that Love was ‘equal in length and
breadth’ to the elements. Her influence is not exerted without physical
penetration. It is useless 10 argue whether the action of these powers is
physical or psychological, for it is both. It could hardly be otherwise
in an age when psychical faculties themselves were conceived materially
as breath or blood.

uncertain but the sense not much in doubt.</p>
</p>
The first clause makes the point that the elements do not lose their
<p>separate identities when they mingle with each other to form a world.
The rest of the passage refers to the fact that in the contest between the
two opposing forces some bodies are formed which combine easily
with others, and of these Love makes further compounds; whereas
others are of a structure that forbids their mixture so that Strife has his
way with them and they remain separate beings or substances.                                 Ex-
amples are given in fr. o1 in the different behaviour of water in relation
to wine and oil. This ‘fitness for mixture’ or otherwise is dependent on
the size of the microscopie openings in each body.
The nature of the elements and their behaviour under the influence
<p>of Love and Strife is so impartant that Empedocles daes not hesitate to
repeat his points in different ways. Thus in fr. 21:
Come now, see this witness to my former words, should anything in them
have been lacking in form: the sun white to see and hot all over, all the divine
things which are bathed in heat (?) and the bright ray, and the rain in all
things dark and cold; and from the earth spring things rooted and solid. In
Anger all are diverse and sundered, but in Love they come together and are
desired of each other.        For out of these are born whatever was and is and
will be—trees, men, women, beasts, birds and water-feeding fishes, yea and
long-lived gods highest in honours. There are just these, but running
through     one another they alter their appearance: so far does mixture
effect change.

(Bignone abjected that these are not immonal, éuppore; b they were commonty thought to be
divine, and Empedocles by his own confession makes use of popular expressions.) It is more
likely that by the plural he intended only the particles of air, but the kne remains obscure. It
appears only in Simplicius whereas Aristotle and Plutarch quote vv. 3 and 5 consecutively.         oo’
eldet (= heat) e is a conjecture of Diels for various unintelligible readings in the MSS. of
Simplicius.
 Since air for Empedocles is synonymous with sky (22.2), it is natural enough that he should
<p>speak of it as bathed in the heat and light of the sun.

We have then six ultimate factors, four passive and two active.
<p>Although Love and Strife are invisible and unimaginably fine and
tenuous {more so, obviously, than air or fire), and although their
influence is in the first place a psychological one, their spiritual character
is not yet completely divorced from physical form. Qnly by being in
the world and mingling with the ever-living elements can they inspire
 them with the feelings which cause them either to come together in
mutual embrace or to draw apart in cold exclusiveness each to itself.
The secondary effects of these proceedings are physical and are the out-
come of chance. How this happens will emerge in subsequent sections,
which will show that those are fully justified who claim, in spite of the
original psychological impulse (which they frequently ignore), that
Empedocles deserves to go down to history as the first European to
introduce into science the idea of a force operating on matter, At the
same time the thoughts of a Sicilian Greek of the fifth century B.c. are
not so simple as such critics sometimes think.</p>

                            NECESSITY           AND      NATURE
<p> 1t was held against Empedocles in antiquity, particularly by Aristotle,
 that having posited six and only six ultimate principles he then found
 them insufficient for the construction of a world and smuggled in two
 more, Chance ( Tyche) and Necessity (Ananke). Some modern scholars,
                                               59
<p>                                         Empedocles
like Bignone (&amp;mped. 306n.), have thought this a real weakness in his
system,     Aristotle writes (GC, 334a7):               What is the prime mover and
cause of motion? It cannot be Love and Strife, for they are the causes
of a particular 4ind of motion.” What kind of motion, he has stated
earlier (333b 12): “ They are the causes of aggregation and segregation
respectively.’t
In this chapter Atistotle sees things from his own viewpoint, namely
<p>the releological.      For him, as he says in the Physics, there are only two
possible explanations of events, chance or purpose. Chance fannot be
responsible for regularity (what happens ‘always or for the most part’),
therefore that must be the result of purposive causation. But in general
pature does exhibit regularity (e.g. a grain of wheat always                            produces
more      wheat, never olives), therefore nature works                         teleologically.
Chance events only occur occasionally, and argue failure of purpose
rather than its absence.
With this outlock he could not fail to find Empedocles wrong-
<p>headed,? but it is not an outlook that all would share. For instance,
Empedocles        attributes      the    constiation        of different        organic      sub-
stances to the proportion in which the elements are mixed in them.
This proportion is a chance outcome of the interaction of Love and
Strife, Now the word for proportion is logos, but loges had many
other meanings in Greek, some of which have reference only to
the behaviour of rational beings: it can mean thought or the result
of thought. Aristotle commits what amounts to a play on words when
he continues: ‘What then is the cause of this Jogos? Not presumably
fire or earth, but neither is it Love or Strife, for the one is the cause
of aggregation, the ather of segregation. The cause is the essential
nature of each’—a shameless introduction of Aristotelian ideas which
would have meant nothing to Empedocles—*and not solely “mingling</p>
</p>
</p>
</p>
<p>  ! Mallerd agreed (Emped. 35): the evidence seems to prove ‘that Love and Strife were not
conceived by lum as universal " motor causes”, but as having the specialized function of effecung
and dissolving certain combinations of the elements’.
  <em> H. A. T. Reiche, in Empedocles’s Mixture, argues that (as he says on p. 38) the role of
mechanism in Empedocles ss of purely secondary, subsidiary importance: </em> Unlike Diogenes, he
had no grounds   for thinlung of human    reason and <em></em> technology”   as anything other than 3 less
pecfect copy of, and approximation to, the unconscious purposefulness of Nature at its best.”
This would make his position exactly the same as Aristotle’s, and if it were true, Aristode’s
repeated castigation of him as a mechanist would be incompretiensible,

<p>                         Causation: the Role of Chance
and separation of what is mingled” as he puts it. But the right name
for this is chance, not logos, for it is possible for things t© be mingled
fortuitously.”
There is no evidence that Empedocles used the word lgos in this
<p>connexion,! and he certainly taught that organic substances and living
creatures were produced by chance, though the fact that the elements
could combine at all, and retain their union for a time, was due to the
influence of Love. (One can hardly be surprised that Aristotle found
this a little confusing, and asked impatiently in De anime (408a21):
‘Is Love the cause of any chance mixture, or of mixture according to
Iogos?”). Describing the formation of bone, he says afier mentioning
the proportions in which the elements were mixed: ‘And they became
white hones, joined by the wondrous cement of Love” (fr. 96), and
again of blood, ‘Anchored in the perfect havens of Cypris® (98.3). At
the same time, indicating in the same fragment what the appropriate
mixture is, he speaks of earth ‘happening upon’ equal quantities of the
others, and in fr. 85 fire ‘ Chanced to meet” a little earth in the making
of the eye: creatures with soft bodies over a hard skeleton ‘chanced to
get this flaccidity in the hands of Cypris’ (75.2). Again he writes:
‘By the whim of Chance all things think’ (fr. 103), and ‘in so far as the
finest bodies met by chance in their fall’ (fr. 104). In citing these
examples, Simplicius adds (Phys. 331.10): ‘One may find many such
expressions in the Physica of Empedocles.”                       He is enlarging on the
criticism of Aristotle (Phys. t96a11L.) that the earlier natural philoso-
phers, including Empedocles from whom he quotes, though they give
no explanation of chance, do make use of it. Most striking perhaps is
Empedocles’s use of chance as the sole explanation of favourable bio-
logical characteristics such as form the strongest weapon in the teleo-
logist’s armoury. It comes out best in his account of the evolution of
animals by the survival of the fittest (pp. 203f. below), but may be
illustrated by Aristotle’s criticism in De part. anim. 640a19:                              ‘“Em-
pedacles was wrong to say that many characteristics of animals are the

The fragments, then, confirm the fortuitous character of the forma-
<p>tion of organic narure. In spite of his religious outlook and the choice
of Aphrodite, spirit of harmony and goodness, as one of the motive
powers, Empedocles, like the Ionians, is no teleologist in his descrip-
tion of the physical world. This in the eyes of Aristotle, as of Plato
before him,? was a grave fault, but perhaps it is Empedocles and his
predecessors who in this respect showed the more sclermﬁc outlook.
There is little in the charge that he illegitimately smuggled ii chance as
an independent cause over and above those that he overtly recognized.
Apart from the one poetic expression ‘by the whim of Tycke, the noun
does not occur in the fragments, the idea of chance or accidental
occurrence being conveyed by verbs3 Aristotle (Phys. 196a8) says
that those who believe that there is 1o such thing as chance, but that
every event has a definite cause, invoke the earlier philosophers for
this view. These, they say, in their discussions of becoming and dis-
solution, ignore chance and act as if there were no such thing as a
chance event. In his reply Aristotle only remarks that if they omitted
to explain it, they ought not to have done so, since in fact they do avail
themselves of the notion, as for instance Empedocles both in cosmogony
and zoogony. Simplicius, who also had the poem, says the same
(Phys. 331.15): ‘Empedocles is less worth consideration {sc. than the
atomists] since he appears to employ chance in minor matters but never
explains what itis.” The natural conclusion is that Empedocles, like many
in all ages, could speak of things ‘just happening’ or being, ‘accidental”
without supposing chance to be a cause in its own right. His conception
of it may become a little clearer aftet a brief discussion of aranke.

Empedocles,        like Parmenides,         follows     other    poets    and    religious
<p>teachers in speaking of ananke as a personal power. In fr. 116 Lave
“hates intolerable Ananke’, and fr. 115 mentions a decree of Ananke,
Its function in his system evidently puzzled the commentators, who are
wildly inconsistent.       Aétius in one place calls it the One, of which the
four elements are the matter and Love and Strife the form; in another,
he describes it as a cause which makes use of the principles and elements.
Plutarch simply identifies it with Love and Strife, whereas Simplicius
Tists it as a third creative cause. Elsewhere he attributes to Empedocles
a more elaborate scheme in which the two contrarieties exhibited by
the elements (hot—old, dry—wet) are subsumed under the one pair
Love and Strife, and that in turn under the monad ananke.!
We cannot say to what parts of the poem these writers are referring,
<p>but their phraseclogy shows that they were trying to remodel what they
found there into Peripatetic or later forms. Empedocles’s own lines are
unlikely to have gone beyond the simple statement of Aristotle (Phys.
25227): ‘Empedocles appears to have meant that the alternate pre-
dominance as movers of Love and Strife is inherent in things of
necessity.” In other words, in spite of the personification of ananke, he
meant no more than that, the elements and Love and Strife being what
they were, it could not have happened otherwise. One may compare
the comment of Hippolytus on the ‘decree of Ananke” in fr. 1x§ (Ref.
7.29; DK, 1, 3§6£): What he calls Ananke is the change from one to
many caused by Strife, and from many to one by Love.<em>
It must be remembered that for a Greek chance and necessity could
<p>be much the same thing. Orestes can be said to have died ‘by necessary
chance’, which Tecmessa in the 4jax bewails as the worst of evils.
Plato criticizes the cosmogony of non-teleological philosophers like
Empedocles by saying that they make things happen ‘necessarily by
chance’.     A little later he calls the same cause ‘chance and nature

(physisy’<em> All this may sound strange, but represents a consistent
view. Physis in the eyes of these men is a natural necessity inherent in
each separate thing or substance, not a law of interaction between them.
With each thing moving as its own piysis dictates, the clashes between
them will be fortuitous though caused by necessity. By ‘chance’ was
meant ‘a canse not manifest to human reason’ as Aristotle was later to
put it. We can be sure that rain will fall and flames rise, because it is in
their physis to do so. But it is beyond our telling when and where a
portion of fire will encounter a portion of water, and in what propor-
tions they will mix.            In effect, the formation of a cosmos                 s the un-
designed and purposeless result of a clash berween material s\lbstances
each driven in certain ways by its own internal impulse. That is the
essence of this type of cosmology, against which Plato and Aristotle
directed their heaviest batteries in the interests of teleology.
This seems to uncover yet another active factor in the Empedoclean
<p>universe, the internal motive powers of the elements themselves.
Certainly they are not dead matter which would remain completely
inert unless acted on by external forces; but if we try to analyse
Empedocles’s notions of causes and forces and distinguish them in the
Aristotelian manner, we shall be contorting his thoughts and forcing
upon him a logic of which he was innocent. In these matters he was
much nearer to the vagueness of popular thought. According to
him, says Aristotle in De                  anima   (415b28),      plants grow downwards
because earth tends downwards by nature, and upwards because fire
tends upwards.          Somewhat similarly in the chapter of De gen. et corr.
already cited, in which he undertakes to show that Empedocles’s views
on motion and its causes are naive, he says: ‘It is Strife that separates,
yet aither is borne upwards not by Strife, but as he says in one place,
naturally, and in another, by chance (“ For thus it chanced to meet [the
other elements] then in its course, but often otherwise™). Elsewhere
he says that it is the nature of fire to move upwards, yet aither, he says,</p>

<p>                                       Nature as Cause
Aristotle’s head is full of his own ideas, of his distinction between
<p>‘patural’ and ‘enforced” motions and the theory that all natural motion
must be directed towards a predetermined end. What he says amounts
t0 no more than this, that in Empedocles’s mind the movement of each
of the elements was necessary and the concourse of elements fortuitous.
Both were the result of ‘nature’, which was a necessary, not a teleo-
logical, cause. Thus he writes in the Metaphysics (1000b12): ‘He
offers no cause of the change itself, except that it is in the nature of
things. . .as if it is necessary for them to change; but he suggests no
cause for this necessity.” There is however another principle obviously
at work in the elements, namely the attraction of like for like. Any
portion of fire or earth has a natural tendency to seek out and join
other parts of the same element. This too was a universal popular con-
ception. Tannery, noting that for Empedocles it does not appear to be
a transcendent force but an immanent property of matter, added
rightly: “Nous ne pouvons guére penser trouver autre chose i cette
époque.” Ever since Homer, and no doubt long before, it had been
believed that ‘God always brings like to like’ (Od. 17.218), and the
principle appears in various guises in many rational thinkers including
Democritus. Here again critics have claimed to detect Empedocles
invoking another force besides those which have an acknowledged
place in his system. It is admittedly more difficult to correlate with the
external powers          of Love and Strife, for as Aristotle remarked, in
separating unlikes, Strife draws like substances together.? In the many
passages where the principle is invoked, it is not always easy to decide
whether Empedocles conceives himself to be speaking of an inherent
property of matter or of the influence of Strife upon it, as for instance
in fr. 9o: ‘So sweet seized upon sweet, bitter leaped upon bitter, acid
came to acid, and hot rode upon hot.’? That it was an inherent property
  <em> P. 156 above,   Burnet (EGP, 233) writes that ‘we must carefully distinguish between the
Love of Empedacles and that “attraction of like for like”   to which he also attributed an important
part in the formation of the world”.    I cannot see how anyone could be temped to identify this
attraction with Love, which obviously has the opposite effect: the difficulty is to distinguish it
from the influence of Strife.

of things, he would accept as axiomatic without much thought, and
probably Burnet comes nearest the truth in the words (EGP, 233): ‘It
depends on the proper nature of each element, and is only able to take
effect when Strife divides the Sphere.” (In more concrete texms, he
thought that the attraction of like for like was explained by the doctrine
of ‘symmetry of pores’.) Empedocles’s dominant aim was to rescue
the real world from the unity and immobility into which Parmenides
had frozen it. Consequently he would feel bound to start from a con-
ception of it as apparently unitary and static, and show that fthe unity
was not essential, and that motion and change could be injroduced.
This conception, in his system, was represented by the Spherelin which
Love had so completely mingled the elements that their separate natures
were indistinguishable. With this powerful force holding unlikes to-
gether, their natural tendency to seek their like would remain ineffective
without the equally powerful intervention of Strife. Anather reason for
beginning with the state of ‘all things together’ would be that that was
the way in which cosmogony always had started, from the age-old myths
in which earth and heaven were one to the ‘monist’ systems of the
Ionians. His Sphere of Lave resembles especially the primal apeiron of
Anaximander; it is ‘hardly more than a clarification of the confusion
of Anaximander’s thought’.</p>
</em>       His apparent unity becomes, as logically
it had 1o be if the opposites were to be ‘separated out’ from it, a
mixmre. Empedocles had also, following Parmenides, made the
original mass spherical, though at the same time it was unlimited—
a combination of ideas which may also have been present to the mind
of the eatlier thinker (vol. 1, 8y; cf. also for Empedocles p. 170 below).
  In the physical theory of Empedocles we have a transitional stage in
the history of ideas, to which modern thought-categories are not al-
together relevant, and it is more rewarding to understand than to
criticize. The separation of the notions of body and spirit was a very
gradual process, which was not yet completed, even if it may be almost
beyond our powers of expression to say just what stage it had reached.
We have already met Heraclitus’s conception of a ‘rational fire’. In
that there was as yet no hint of a separation, however plain it may seem
that the difficulties of such a composite conception must lead to a break

very soon.   Empedocles has made the break, depositing the motive
force in two separate entities. Yet their action is psychological. It is
love or liking and hatred or anger that strive for mastery among the
elements, and of such impulses it is almost truer to say that they animate
than that they move them. At least the bodies which submit to their
acton are not just dead stuff, and the bestowal of divine names on them
is more than a poetic convention. Nevertheless the importance of
Empedocles is not in the lingering traces of hylozoism but in the great
step forward which he took by declaring that the elements were in-
destructible and immutable, that the cosmos was formed by a mixture
of these unalterable roots in different proportions, and that the motion
necessary to produce the mixture was caused not (in the loose Milesian
way of thinking) by the elements themselves but by distinct forces
working upon them.</p>

                    I.   THE   COSMIC   CYCLE
<p>Further descriptive analysis of our present world, with details of the
formation of organic substances and living creatures, will be best left
until after consideration of the whole cosmic process. This will make
clearer the respective roles of Love and Strife at the present stage of
world-history. The process, described in fr. 17 (p. 153 above) and
elsewhere, is curiously complex. There is a period when Love rules
unopposed, having fused all the elements into a unity. Then Strife
enters the Sphere and begins to separate them until finally he has taken
full possession and each element is isolated from the rest. After this
Love reasserts herself, pervades the whole once more and gradually
brings the separated elements together until once more they are com-
pletely united. A universe of ‘mortal things’, such as that in which we
live, is a temporary stage intermediate between the supremacy of Love
and Strife,a product of the tension and conflict between them. To the old
idea of cosmogony as a ‘separating-out” from an original unity has
been added 2 converse process of coming-together from a state of
separation, which is cosmogonic no less than the other. ‘Double is the
birth of mortal things, and double their failing’ (17.3). There is not
one cosmogony, but an endless succession of wotlds. ¢ Empedocles and
Anaxagoras also produce other things by separation from mixture, but
                                 167
<p>                                        Empedocles
they differ in that Empedocles makes these things happen in a cycle but
Anaxagoras once for all’ (Arist. Phys. 187a23);                            or as Simplicius
describes it more fully (De caelo, 293.18):
Others maintain that the same cosmos comes to be and perishes alternately,
and again arises and perishes, and that this succession goes on for ever. Thus
Empedocles says that Love and Strife gain the ascendancy in turn: Love
brings all things together into one, destroys the cosmos created by Strife
and makes of it the Sphere, whereas Strife separates the elements agam and
creates a world like rhis.
So much is clear, though when we come to consider the detaiis of each
stage of the cycle, the gaps in our knowledge of the poem ra"se prob-
lems which cannot all be solved with certainty.</p>
</p>
                         First stage: the Sphere of Love
<p>‘They never cease thus to alternate continually, now all coming to-
gether into one through Love, and now again each one drawing apart
by Suife’s hatred’ (fr. 17.6-8).               Although the process is thus cyclic,
the logical starting-point is (for reasons given in the preceding section)
the state of unity, when Love has drawn all things together into one.”
Of the resulting Sphere, Hippolytus has preserved a description (Ref.
7.29.13, 1. 29):
Of the shape of the cosmos, what it was like when ordered by Love, he
speaks like this:
“No twin branches spring from its back, there are no feet nor nimble
<p>knees, no parts of generation, but it was a Sphere and in all directions equal
10 itself.’
The first surprise is perhaps to find Empedocles at pains to deny that
the original mixture of the elements is anthropomorphic or therio-
morphic. But for him it is &amp; god, ‘the most blessed god” according to
Aristotle and its obvious prototype is the unitary cosmic divinity of
  ¥ Bigoone (Emped. 220) adopts the contrary procedure, and Millerd (Emped. §3) thinks that
Empedocles himself started from the separated elements.      But her quotation from GC, 333bat
provides no argument, and in fact Anstotle’s evidence is all against the supposition.    CE. rather
De caelo, 301a14~18 (quoted on p. 173 below). More relling in favour of her thesis 1s a fact
mentioned by Bignone that events belonging naturally 10 the period of Strife’s advance are
assigned 1o the second boak of the Piysica {fr. 62), and others suggesting the period of Love to
the first (fr. 96). See his Emped. 5671, In 568, n. 2, however, his inference from the order of the
recurrent cosmic cycle to the order of our own period of Strite is illogical,

which Empedocles was capable of maintaining between the different
parts of his system. In our own imperfect world the highest manifesta-
tions of life, namely intelligence and knowledge, were achieved through
the physical medium exhibiting the most nearly perfect blend of the
elements.” It is in keeping that when an actually perfect blend is
achieved, the product should be the highest form of all life, divinity.
As in Xenophanes also it is unmoved. Further information comes from
Simplicius (Phys. 1183.28):
Eudemus understands the immobility [sc. of which Aristotle speaks at Phys.

wévos (solitude) or vévea (rest, mationlessness) is disputed. The majority of modern critics have
translated it in the first way (DX, Bumet, Millerd, Bignone, Munding, Kranz, KR), but Jaeger,
who like Zeller and LS] renders it ‘rest’, has given a reasoned defence of this interpretation
(TEGP, 141). One of Jaeger's parallels, the papyrus fragment of Tyrtaeus (1.15 in the secand
and 1. 54 in the third editionof Diehl's Anth, Ly7.), must be admitted 10 be doubtful owing to the
condition of the papyrus at this point. However, in the third edition, Diehl {or just possibly
Beutler who published the fascicle after Diehl’s death), though refusing to commit himself in the
text a3 he had done before, not only repeats (from the original publication of the papyrus by
Wilamowitz) bur also adds to the references supporting the reading and the meaning ‘stead-
fastness, staying where one is’,     (Note especially «ayoviny in J/ 22.257.)          Perhaps the most
relevant comparison is the pluve of Xenophanes’s sphenical god (fr. 26, vol, 31, 374), since the
influence of Xenophanes on Empedocles in this matter js pretty clear, The context 1 Simplicits
makes it practically certain that at any rate he and Eudemus took the ward to mean that the
Sphere was motionless. More recently J. B. Bauer in Hermes, t961, has again acgued for die
connexion of wovly with wévos, bur would reader it not *solitude’ (Einsamkeit) but “oneness’ or
“atrainment of unity® (Einssein),
Tlepwiytis can also mean ‘surrounding” rather than ‘circular’. So Millerd (Emped. 60) trans-
<p>lates ‘the isolation that surrounds him’, and DK (repeated by Munding, Hermes, 1954, 143) “die
ringsum herrschende Einsamkeis". With Jaeger’s translation of uovin one could render it similarly
“the surrounding stillness®. In fact however, whatever be the exact reference of Azt. 1.5.2 (447),
Empedocles has na thought of any mepiéxov. The limitless Sphere (fr. 28) contains all that is.</p>

their context, state that the                Sphere      is ‘altogether       withour limit’,
Empedocles must have aimed this at the emphatic limitation of the
spherical whole by Parmenides, bur we do not possess (as we do with
Melissus) his reasons for the change. It is clear however that he saw
no incompatibility between limitlessness (in whatever sense; cf. vol. 1,
85) and spherical shape.
 At this stage the Sphere is permeated through and through by Love,
<p>and Strife has been driven to its furthest limits: spatial relegation is the
necessary concomitant of ineffectiveness. ‘If Strife were nof in among
things [sc. as it is now], all would be one according to him’, says
Aristotle (Metaph. 100ob1), quoting the last half of fr. 36. ‘As [the
elements) came together, Strife retired 1o the outermost edge.” These
spatial relationships are emphasized in fr. 35, which describes the
gradual process whereby the full supremacy of Love is attained (pp.
178 £. helow).
The reign of Love, then, presents a Sphere containing the four
<p>elements so thoroughly blended by her co-presence with them as to
be indistinguishable, with their normally antithetic characteristics in
abeyance. (Cf. Philoponus in A41.) Consequently there is peace and
rest, ‘no division nor unseemly contention in the limbs’.! The whole is
effectively, if temporarily, a unity, and is called a god, like the divine
All of Xenophanes from which it derives and which enjoyed a similar
tranquillity,      Strife bides his time on the outer fringe of this Sphere.
There is little point in asking in what precise sense it is a unity. Any
explanation must be historical. Anaximander doubtless thought of his
apeiron as a unity, but more critical ages, seeing that in some sense it
must have contained the elements of a cosmos, described it as a mixture.?
Empedocles, schooled by Parmenides, grasped that the unitary phase
must contain the elements, since out of a strict unity no plurality could
arise, and spoke of Love as uniting them ‘into one’ (els &amp;). In
&quot; Fe. 273, quoted anonymously by Phitarch, but plausibly ascribed to Empedocles by Wil-
<p>mowicz. That the Sphere is motionless is the general opinian of anclent critics (e.g. Simplicius and
Eudemus quoted above, Arist. Phys. 252a7-10, wherte presumably kparelv refers to the process of
gammg the mastery), apart from the disputed question whether wevln in Empedacles himself

writing of him Aristotle sometimes copies this phrase or calls the Sphere
‘the One’,? and at other times charactetizes it asa mixture.” Empedocles
had not advanced beyond the notion of mechanical mixture (as §F of
this chapter should have made clear), but the important point is that
under the unchallenged influence of Love the elements have become
(2) so inextricably mingled, and (4) so ‘dear” to one another that all
their otherwise antagonistic characteristics have become subdued and
indeed annihilated in an ineffable harmony.3</p>
                      Second stage: the advance of Strife
<p>‘As Strife begins to gain once more, motion begins again in the
Sphere: “For (fr. 31) one by one all the limbs of the god quiver.”’
So Simplicius (Phys. 1184.2) introduces fr. 31.                       A quotation which
must have stood in close context with this is preserved by Aristotle
(fr. 30):
But when great Strife waxed strong in the limbs and leaped to power as the
time was fulfilled which is fixed for them in turn by a broad oath. . ..</p>
<p>On     this Aristotle comments             (Mezapk.       1000b12)       that Empedocles
offers no cause of the change itself: it seems to happen naturally. The
words, he says, imply that the change is necessary, but the reason for
this necessity is nowhere made clear. There is probably little more to
be said about the way in which Empedocles tackled the problem—
inescapable since Parmenides—of how to introduce motion intu a
motionless sphere. The Sphere was no longer a true unity, and motive
powers existed. This seemed sufficient, and the question why one or
other of the forces started to become efective at a particular time was
  <em> GC, 335a6; Meraph. 984210, 985228, 1000228 and bz,
  </em> Phys. 187a23; Mesaph. 1092b7 ard 1069b22. In the last of these passages he couples
Empedocles and Anaximander together. At one place (Metaph. 99628) he even sess in Love an
anticipatian of his awn notion of the undifferentiated substratum (tmorelusvav) of che physical
world. We know thar he was worried by Empedocles’s apparent characterization of it as at once
moving cause and part of the mixture, and here he is probably identifying Love with the Sphere
in which it is everywhere supreme and the elements have lost their separate identities. CE. fora
wore tentative starement 1ootat4 (Bumet, £GP, 236, n. 1).
Aristotle also accuses Empedocles of contradicting himself by saying (a) that no element comes
<p>to be out of another element, and (8) that when everything save Strife is gathered together ‘into
one’, each of them is born again from <em>‘the one’ (GC, 315a3).

same eternal law as the cyclic wanderings of individual }isouls. One
might guess at the physical means by which it happened. XPossibly in
the age-long struggle to win the victory and hold its gains} the victor
temporarily exhausted his strength while his rival’s powers were re-
couped. But ultimately it is a religious sanction governing macrocosm
and microcosm alike, analogous to the cosmic justice which in Anaxi-
mander’s world ensured that none of the opposites gained a final
advantage over any other.
Strife, then, enters the Sphere and initiates a motion which disrupts
<p>it. As Love loosens her hold, the tendency of each element to seek its
like asserts itself, and they begin to draw apart. In psychological or
moral terms (equally important for Empedocles) the seeds of hate and
exclusiveness are sown in the perfect harmony of the divine Sphere.
in the course of their separation our world is formed, in which large
masses of the elements have already been separated—the earth, the sea,
the air, and (as he believed) fire at the circumference—Dbut the process is
not complete.     ‘Strife and Love are still fighting with one another’
(Aristotle, GC, 315a16). For one thing each of the main masses still
contains some portion of another element; we see rivers springing out of
the earth, and fire erupting from beneath its surface. Secondly, there
exists the variety of organic creatures which are formed of several
elements mingled in different proportions.
A similar stage must of course be reached in the complementary
<p>period when Love is on the increase, but our own world is that of
advancing Strife. On this point the explicit statements of Aristotle are
in accord with what we know of Empedocles’s own account. ‘He says
that the cosmos is similar now under the influence of Strife to what

it was      formerly      under      the influence         of Love’™          In De caelo he
gives an odd reason for this, but the passage is further evidence for
the fact.
To make the world-process start from things in motion and separate is
irrational, That is why Empedocles passes over the process of formation in
the period when Love is prevailing; he could not have built up his universe
by making it out of separate elements and combining them by Love. The
elements of the cosmos are in a state of separation, so that its formation must
have proceeded from unity and combination.</p>

</em>
Simplicius says the same thing several times, for instance De caelo,
590.19: ‘He says that the elements wete formerly combined by Love,
and later as they became separated by Strife formed this world of ours.’
1In Empedocles himself and the doxography the formation of the world
is described as a separation of the elements from a primal mixture, first
into their cosmic arrangement (a30) and then into living creatures.
Thus in fr. 62 the first men and women originate from certain ‘whole-
natured’, i.e. less differentiated forms of life, which in turn were con-
structed out of earth, water and fire as a result of fire siruggling 1o
rejoin its like.<em> Again, trees are both the earliest form of life and, cor-

   * De caelo, 301214. 1 call Aristotle’s reasoning odd because it would only be necessary to
suppose cosmogony to occur at an early siage in Love’s progress, just as it must ocour at an
advanced stage of Strife’s. He is really arguing, not logically, but under the influence of the age~
 old idea that if there is to be cosmogony, it must proceed from mixture to separation. His state~
 ment here is confined to the genesis of the odpavés and perhaps of the inorganic world. He knew
 that Empedocles did describe the genesis of Living things in the period of increasing Love, for he
 has just said so (3oobag).
   3 CL also ibid. 2931850 (quoted above, p. 168), 528.11, Millerd objects (op. cir. 47) that
 Neoplatonic statements are here valueless because they only mean that this world is not the
 Sphere. Admittedly Simplicius had not a full appreciation of the cycle. For instance at 528.8f.
 he misunderstands Arist. De caclo, 295229 because he cannot conceive of the elements ever being
 wholly separated. Nevertheless I doubt if the criticism is relevant to the present passages, and on
 two of them Millerd notes that ‘the order of treacment of Empedocles seems here ta be ohserved”’.
 Formmnately however we are by no means confined to Simplicius for evidence.
    * Tt can hardly be argued that this account of the origin of the human race belongs to the other
 half of the cycle and not our own. When Empedocles does describe the origin of animal life by a
 reverse process of combination, later writers are careful to state explicitly thar this takes place in
 the period of Lave, but in all the many details of our own world they see, as ane might expect,
 na reason to specify the period.    (See Millerd, Emped. 49f)      Tt is in any case overwhelmungly

respondingly, contain the elements in a more thoroughly mingled state
than others (a70, pp. 208f. below).                       Most significant of all, on the
religious and moral side, our world exhibits a degeneration from an age
of peace and harmony ruled over by Aphrodite to one of discord and
slaughter (fr. 128).
   The cosmogonic motion of the Sphere initiated by Strife is a revolv-
ing or whirling one (Greek diné). This is a simple inference from
cosmology—the visible movements of the heavenly bodies—to cos-
mogony, followed also by Anaxagoras, who begins his cpsmogony
with a revolution initiated by Nous, and by the atomists. I;g physical
mechanism will be discussed later. Begun at a very early stige in the
break-up of the Sphere, it brings about the separation of the Sest of the
elements ‘by the impetus of the revolution’.

                              Third stage: Strife triumphant
From passages like fr. 17.7-8 (=26.5~6) and 21.7-8, it is evident that
there comes a time when, in complete contrast to the union of the
elements in Love, they are all completely separated by Strife.? But
the surviving information is too scanty to answer all our guestions
about this state of things. There are only two lines of Empedocles,?
which are, however, quoted by Plutarch in a descriptive context.
probable that he would follow all his predecessors, both mythical and philosophical, in the
universal assumption that our world is the result of éméepiors from a wévra ducl and not the
reverse, an assumption which contipues in Anaxagoras and the atomists. The view of Zeller
(ZN, 577) that our world is the world of increasing Love has been 5o often refuted that it can be
disregarded. See eg. Millerd, 50—z, Bignone, 561, and his appendix on the cosmic cycle in
general.
   * For discussion of the evidence see p. 186 below. The explanation of the origin of the 8ivn
given by the Stromater's (430) is plain enough, and there was no need for Zeller to say (ZN, 980,
. 1) that we have no record of it, or Munding (Hermes, 1954, 144) %0 say simply that the gradual
graweh of Strife, distupting che Sphere, was itself pictured as 2 §lvn,
   * Aristotle’s paraphrases of these or other passages are in accord. So Meraph. 985az25; * When
the whole is divided into its elements hy Strife, then fire is collected 1nto one mass and so is each
of the orher elements’; and De caelo, 295a30: “When the elements had been separated off by
Seife....”

that ta describing twa contrary seates which yet have ane impactac point in cammon (abseace

ahalf-line (pp. 1364, 154£. above).

                                 Strife Triumphant
In his dialogue On the phenomenon of @ face in the moon’s circle, he
writes (926d):
Take care that you don’t, by transposing each thing and relegating it o its
nawral place, bring about by your philosophy a dissolution of the cosmos
and saddle things with the Strife of Empedocles—or rather rouse against
nature the Titans and giants of old—and find that what you want to see, by
separating all that is heavy from all that is light, is that mythical and fearful
disorder and discord, when as Empedocles says:
             ‘Neither is the bright form of the sun distinguished
           nor yet the shaggy earth® nor the sea.”
Earth had no portion of heat, nor water of air; nothing heavy was aloft,
nothing light below; the principles [elements] of all things, unmixed, un-
loving and solitary, not admitting combination or association but avoiding
and shunning one another and moving with their own stubborn motions,
wete in the state in which Plato [7T4m. 53b] says everything is from which
God is absent—that is, as bodies are when mind and soul have deserted them;
until desirability came over nature providentially when Love, Aphrodite, or
Eros was implanted in it, as Empedocles says and Parmenides and Hesiod.
   The language of the sentence following the quotation leaves no
doubt that Platarch’s speaker is stili paraphrasing Empedocles, It
suggests to him a comparison with the random motion of the Platonic
chaos before the divine reason of the Creator got to work on it,
and the comparison has this much point, that Empedocles o0 was
describing a state of things furthest removed from the divinity of the
Sphere. It does not follow that the motions themselves were similar,
but the parallel would hardly have occurred to Plutarch if in fact the
elements had been motionless under Strife as in the divine mixture
brought about by Love.              Their motion is confirmed by the passage
in De caelo (301214) where Aristotle says that Empedocles omitted
to describe the cosmogony of the period when Love is taking over
from Strife owing to the difficulty of describing a process of genesis
from ‘separate and moving’ elements.
   This evidence may be reinforced by more general considerations.
When conflict and discord prevail, it is unlikely that the result would be
peace and rest such as are the ultimate product of love and concord and

of Bergk and DK. He compares Hes. T#. 161.

(as Empedocles would agree with the Pythagoreans) are good and desir-
able states.! There was moreover, in Presocratic systems and especially
since Parmenides, a general tendency to associate unity with rest, and
plurality withmotion.* There arehowever one or twoancient testimonies
which might suggest a different state of things, and unfortunately in
the absence of Empedocles’s own wordsitis difficult to be certain. There
is for instance an attractive simplicity about Zeller’s explanation that
Both processes [sc. of separation and combination] continue until complete
union on the one hand, or complete separation on the other, is a’hieved, and
this is also the duration of the movement and life of nature, and the formation
and destruction of individual things.              As soon as the goal is réached, that
movement ceases, the elements stop combining or separating—abecause they
are completely mixed or separate—and will remain in this state untl it is
disturbed by a new impulse in the opposite direction.
   This interpretation goes back to Aristotle’s statement in the Physics
(250b26) that according to Empedocles ‘things are alternately in
motion and at rest, in motion when Love is making the one out of
many or Strife many out of one, and at rest in the intervening periods’;
and it depends on supposing that Aristotle is referring to two periods
of rest. His precise meaning is by no means certain, and it has generally
been thought that he was misled by misunderstanding »v. 9-13 of fr. 17
which he quotes. That is, that he has erroneously assumed éwivnTor
(‘unchanged’, of the everlasting elements) to mean ‘unmoved’4    A
  * Pfligersdorffer even says (perhaps a tnfle 100 blundy) ‘Strife is movement, as Love is rest”
(Posidonios, 110, n. 2).
   * Thus when at the beginning of the Physics Aristotle enumerates the possible number and
kinds of &pxal, Simplicius (22.16) comments that he omits one theoretical possibility ‘hecause
the opinion has never been held thar the épyed are many and morionless’.      Cf, Anstotle himself
at Metaph. 1004b29 ovdots Tol tvés xivnos &8 ol mARGous. For Parmenides of course, whom
Empedocles respects to the limit compatible with the existence of a phenomenal world, the
association of unity and rest was a matter of logical necessity,
   3 IN, 971 translated. That the natural processes of this world have ceased, and that the ele-
ments can no longer continue the process of separation, 15 of cousse true, but for Zeller there was
no more to he said, Evidently in his view this implied an absalute standstill.
  # Aristotle’s meaning was already disputed among bis Greeh commentators, see Simpl. Phys.
1124, Simphcius’s own opinion was that Aristotle had taken ddvaat to mean literally unmoved,
and this has been widely asserted since Zeller’s time, e.g. by von Arnim, Feszschr. Gomperz, 18;
Millerd, Emped. 543 Bigaone, Emped. 592, n. t a0d elsewhere; Corntoed ad foc. in Laeh Physics:
Ross, Physics ad loc.; Cherniss, ACP, x75; Munding, Hermes, 1954, 135; Solmsen, HSCP, 63,
277 and Ariszoile’s System, 223, n. 4; Kahn, Anaximander, 23. Whether or not Aristotle mis-
understood éxfvrrar in this way (Q'Brien (for whom see p. 183 below) argues thar le did not),
those who think he did still differ among themselves as to whether he was thinking of one petiod
of rest in each complete cycle or two.

                                                176
                                  Surife Triumphant
lirde fater in the same book (252a7), Aristotle repeats his statement,
bur with ‘period” in the singular: ‘ It happens to things of necessity that
Love and Strife prevail and move them in turn, and they are at rest for
the intervening period’; and his pupil Eudemus refers this period of
rest only to the Sphere under the reign of Love (ap. Simpl. 1183.28).
    Another of Aristotle’s criticisms is puzzling. Empedocles helieved,
he says, that the earth is kept in its central position by the rapid revolu-
tion of the heavens, but this could not hold when the elements had been
completely separated from one another by Strife: ‘for he cannot adduce
the vortex at this stage too’ (Cael. 295a31). This has been taken as
evidence that not only vortical motion, but all motion, will have ceased
in the universe. But those who cite this and Phys. 250b26 ff. as un-
equivocal evidence for Aristotle’s opinion® should at least take into
account the mention of ‘separate and moving elements’ at Cael.
3ora1g as well
   In trying to describe the state of things when Strife is supreme our
sources were in all probability making conjectures in the absence of
anything on the subject in Empedocles’s own poem.? It is natural ro
suppose      that   the separated         elements      were     arranged      in concentric
circles with earth at the centre. This is perhaps implied by Aristotle’s
criticism about the vortex, and accords also with observation: at the
advanced stage of Strife which the present cosmos has reached, the
main masses of earth, water, air and fire have in fact adopted this
arrangement. Butitis nowhere explicitly stated.3 Nor canwe he certain
how long Strife remained in undisputed sway. Most probably there
  * So Millerd, Emped. 53 £.; Cherniss, #CP, 205. Butcf, also Bignone, Zmped. 562,n.3. O’Brien
offers an explanation based on the assumption that, since the state of complete separation is anly
womentary, the words refer to the ume when Love is beginning to increase. Then, for the ele-
menta to become mingled, heavy things would have 10 move outwards, which is the contrary of
the effect caused by a &ivn as Aristotle understood it.
   * Thus Millerd concludes (p. 54): ‘Itis not impossible that Empedocles himself left the matter
ambiguaus.. . . Save in the brief inigal summary there would be no need for an account of the
wansition from the end of the period of Strife 10 the beginning of the period of Love. Here he
may have contented himself with some such siatement as that “Strife had now won complete
sway and separated the elements, Love re~entered and he withdrew to the depths of the world."**
Zeller too (ZN, 973, n. 1) suggests that Empedocles may have given a detailed descripdon of the
Sphere bur omitted, or only mentioned tn passing, the opposite state of absolute separation.
   * Bignone (pp. 223 and 562, n. 3) thinks it is shown by Arist. Cael. 205230 in conjunction with
Plue. De facie 926§, where the elements are said ta be dispased in order of weight or highness.
Itis just possibly relevant to this paine that Aristotle chides Empedocles, along with Anaxagaras,
for having offered no explanation of hghtness or weight (Cael. 309319).

     12                                         177                                    cnrir

was only an instantaneous changeover                         from the completion of the
separating process to the beginning of gradual reunion by Love. The
cycle could then be divided into three equal® periods: Strife to Love,
Sphairos, and Love to Strife.                  One would still have to describe the
elemental relation as fourfold—completely united, separating, com-
pletely separated, uniting—but the third of these would be represented
by a moment of transition only. This would explain the Jack of any
agreed explanation of what happens during the reign of Stife, and
receives support from the difficulty of imagining any stability in a state
of things where conflict and discord rage unchecked.
                    Fourth stage: the advance of Love
Our main source for this part of the cosmic cycle is some lines of
Empedocles himself. Unfortunately their purport is not alogether
clear, and they have lent themselves 10 a variety of interpretations.? As
the situation will be understood here, they should be translated as
follows (fr. 35, vv. 3fL.):
When Strife reached the lowest depth of the vortex, and whenever Love
finds herself in the midst of the whirl, there all things come together to be
one only-—not suddenly, but combining from different directions at will.3
And as they came together, Strife began to retire to the boundary.? Yet
many remained unmixed alternating with those that were mingling, all those,
  * At Phys. 252231 Aristotle has the note: 18 8 kat &t° foww Ypdvew Setrat Adyou Tivds. Like
many of his notes, it is somewhat isolated and reads like an afterthought, but it seems to refer back
ta the statement &v whoet 7O wav fpeusiv kol Kueiabon wéhv.      This could refer ta either a three-
period or a four-period cycle (whether or not the zeign of Strife in the latter were one of rest),
for the brief jotting need mean only that each of the periods occupied the same time: it need not
imply that the total of the periods of rest equalled the total of the periods of motion. [ cannot
believe ina reiga of Strife that was also a period of rest, and would conclude that Empedocles had
in mind either a three-period cycle or one in which the reign of Strife was much as Plutarch
describes it.
   O’Brien argues that complete separation is instantaneous but that the Sphairos lasts as Jong as
the whole period of movement, from unity to separation and back again.

                               The Advance of Love
that is, that Strife still held back in suspense; for it had not all retired blame-
lessly from them to the furthest ends of the circle, but parts of it remained
within while other parts had passed out of the limbs. But as much as it
continued to run forth, so there ever pursued it a gentle immortal stream
of blameless Love. Then quickly those things grew mortal that before
knew immortality, and those that were unmixed became mixed as
they changed their ways.” And as they mingled a myriad tribes of mortal
creatures were poured forth, endowed with all sorts of shapes, a wonder
to behold.
   As Love increases her power over the elements, which also means
physically occupying an increasing area among them, Strife is gradually
driven out to and beyond their confines. The view most commonly
held today is that the same thing happens to Love as she is overcome by
Strife. The two change places, each banishing the other outside the
world and then invading it again from that position. On the transla-
tion given above, the effect of Strife’s re-entry is to drive Love towards
the centre and force her to contract. *As he continues his victorious
progress he penetrates the whole sphere to its lowest (i.e. innermost)
depth, and Love is penned into the very centre of the whirling mass—
whirling, becanse the effect of Strife has been to make it rotate at ever~
increasing speed (p. 186 below). The process resembles the systole and
diastole of the heart, a physiological analogy which is quite in keeping
with the tenour of Empedocles’s thought. (See Burnet, T%ales to Plato,
73.) The opening lines therefore describe the moment of Strife’s
supremacy. At this point, probably with no pause at all, Love once
more begins to expand and, starting from the centre, the elements
gradually unite with one another to form another world containing
mortal creatures. Emphasis is laid on the gradual nature of this process
and the reluctant and fighting retreat carried out by Strife. The meaning
of immortal things becoming mortal is explained by what follows. They
are the indestructible and changeless elements, which by mingling form
mortal things like plants and animals. ‘In that they have learned to
 grow one from many. . . they suffer becoming, but in that they never
    ¢ The readingof »». 14 and 15 varied in antiquity and has been much discussed. The most recent
 treatment is that of Mr D. O’Brien, in CR, 1965, 1~4. I find his arguments convincing, and
 have followed them in preference to those of Miss Arundel (CR, 1962, 109-11) and Verdenius
 and Waszink (Arist, on Coming-to-de, 67).

cease...’ (fr. 17.9fl.,p. 153 above), though of course the language of
becoming and perishing is not used stricdy (fr. 9, p. 156). In this part
of the cycle a natural world evolves by a process the reverse of that
which occurred under the ascendancy of Strife. Instead of 'whole-
natured’ animate lumps in which separate limbs and organs gradually
become distinct, we have the curious conception of isolated limbs
combining        at first haphazard            into all sorts of strange creatures
before they settled into the familiar species of a workd like our
own! It is to this part of the cycle also that Bigno le (Emped.
 5641.) would refer a brief and puzzling sentence in Aétus (1.5.2,
447) that in Empedocles there is one cosmos only, ‘but thé cosmos is
not the whole, but a small part of the whole: the rest is idle matter’,
This idle or unformed matter would then be all that ‘remained un-
mixed, alternating with the things that were mingling, all those, that is,
that Suife still held back in suspense’; in other words, such portions of
the four elements as had not yet been combined by Love to form the
compound structures of the natural world. This is perhaps the best
explanation, for it is certainly impossible to suppose that any unused
matter existed, like the apeiron of Anaximander, outside and beyond
the sphere of the four elements and Love and Strife; yet it is surprising
that the doxographer should use the word cosmos without qualification
to refer, not to the present warld, but to thae which farms the opposite
phase of the cycle. (Cf. p. 173, n. 4 above.) The passibility of either a
misunderstanding or a wrong attribution cannot be dismissed.?

                                            Conclusion
 In outline the world-process of Empedocles is plain enough. To divideit
 into four phases seems the clearest and most logical way of explaining it
 (evenif one of them was instantaneous), though without any intention of

claiming that they were so enumerated by Empedocles himself.* 1f they
were, the misunderstandings of Neoplatonic and other commentators
could hardly have arisen. But the evidence of Aristotleand Theophrastus
(p- 173, n. 1 above), supported by the fragments, is decisive for the sub~
stantial correctness of the thesis that (&) the cycle contains two world
periods, developed between the divine commingled Sphere of Love and
the utter separation and estrangement of the elements under Strife, and
(b)) we are now living in the phase of Strife’s increasing influence. In
assessing the interpretations of the Neoplatonic writers, it is important
to remember that they saw the early philosophersin the distorting mirror
of their own belief in two everlasting realms of existence, the sensible
and the intelligible. Simplicius as well as Philoponus attempted to find
in Empedocles an early adumbration of this Platonic ontology, in which
the divine Sphere represented the intelligible realm and the rest of the
cycle was foreshortened into a picture of the sensible. The whole is, in
their eyes, an analysis of the permanent constitution of reality and our
relation to it, metaphorically expressed, for instructional purposes, in
genetic terms.? It is all the more remarkable, and a tribute to his
scholarly conscience, that Simplicius provides so much of the material
from which we can reconstruct the unique Empedoclean scheme of two
world-processes operating in contrary directions, and refuses to gloss
over all the difficulties in his own simplified version.
   The boldness of Empedocles’s conception, and the thoroughness and
consistency with which be applied its principles in a detailed explana-
tion of the natural world, afford an extraordinary demonstration of the
power of the human imagination disciplined, but not inhibited or
rendered ineflective, by the intellect. He was, says Aristotle (Metaph.
985a29), the first to divide the motive principle into two contrary
forces, and the question has often been asked, what the motive for such
elaboration can have been. If he wished simply to restore reality to the
physical world and its processes, and rescue them from the Parmenidean

denial of motion and plurality, then a single cause and a single process
would have sufficed, once plurality had been restored within the ulti-
mate constitution of matter. This was how the case appeared to Anaxa-
goras: given a plurality of qualimtively different elemental ‘seeds’,
only Nous was required 1o set the mass in motion. The only convincing
answer is that for Empedocles the moral and religious order was as
important as the physical, and in equal need of explanation. For this
he turned to the primeval force of Love,” which since Hesiog and the
Orphic writers, if not eatlier, and even in the *Way of Seegning’ of
Parmenides himself, had been recognized as a cosmogonic aswell as a
moral power.       But Love could not explain everything.                  ‘Sinde   nature
plainly contained things contrary to the good—not only order and
beauty but disorder and ugliness—and the bad outnumbered the good
and the worthless the fine, [Empedocles] introduced Love and Strife,
each of them the cause of one of these qualities’ (Arist. Meraph.
984b32). Empedocles was haunted also by another ancient dogma
which told of increasing disharmony between man and nature and his
degeneration from a physically and morally superior type. Linked in
his mind with this tradition of a past Golden Age was the belief current
in his own Western lands that the bodily existence of men is a punish-~
ment imposed on essentially divine spirits. Why had they fallen ? What
was the source of pain and evil? If Love was active as a unifying force
both in the world at large and in the hearts of men (fr. 17.22f.), must
there not be another and even stronger power now urging both in the
direction of disintegration and evil? And what could this be but Love’s
opposite, cursed hatred, strife (£ris), Ares?* Given two opposing
forces, they might have remained eternally locked in an indecisive
struggle like the ‘everlasting fire’ of the Heraclitean cosmos; but this
would have left unexplained the degeneration from a Golden Age of
bounteous, beneficent nature and sinless man; and if that demand was
to be satisfied, then the Greek, with his instinct for symmetry and
reciprocity (one thinks, for example, of the ‘justice’ of Anaximander),

and his conception of time as a circular rather than a linear process,
demanded that there should be a compensating age of increasing Love.
That this era Jay beyond the bounds of our experience was no barrier
to his ever-fertile mind.?
                    Additional note: the interpretation of fr. 35
The interpretation of these difficult lines given on pp. 178f. was only
reached after much heart-searching and represents a reversal of my
previous opinion undergone in the course of writing.                               Ever since I
listened to Cornford’s lectures and first read Burnet’s Early Greek
Philosophy I had taken it for granted that »v. 3 and 4 described the
Sphairos of the reign of Love. Strife was outside (fvéprarovixero péveos),
and Love ‘in the middle of the whirl’, which must be supposed to
mean ‘ occupying the whole of it”. Under her influence the elements now
join together, though notall at once (v». § and 6), so as to allow of the
formation of a world of creatures out of the partly-mixed elements
(though one would have thought that once Love was everywhere in
the sphere she would already have brought about complete union).
   The other interpretation, that »». 3 and 4 describe the victory of
Strife, who has penetrated from circumference to centre and penned
Love in the very middle, was given by Burnet in From Thales to Plato
(1914), p. 73, though wirhout discussion, and curiousty enough in all
three editions of £GP (1892, 1908 and 1920) he writes that as Strife
enters the sphere Love is driven outside it. The case for the supposition
that Love is driven to the centre by Strife’s predominance has tended
to go by default, since of the few scholars who have adopted it none
has done more than state it without argument. (Besides Burnet, see
e.g. Robin, Greck Thought, Eng. tr. 104.) However, Mr D. O’Brien,
   ' Ch. Mugler (Devenir Cycligue, 461.) points out that there can also have been a purely scientific
or physical justification for the introduction of the two opposing forces. In Anaximander, differ~
entiation (&méxpiois) creates a wotld which is destroyed by reabsorption. Empedocles saw that
differentiation itself, if continued unchecked, would be equally destructive to organic structures,
It was, Mugler sugggests, this discovery that gave him the idea of substituting for the unique force
of Anaximander the antagonism of two contrary forces counteracting each other. I may have
done less than justice 1o this interesting suggestion, but I am sure it is equally mistaken to leave
out the religious and moral motives which I believe to have had even more influence in bringing
Empedocles to his conception.     Mugler goes on to detect i him a first sketch of the oscillation
berween actual and poreatial energy, familiar in modern physics, as well as the law of the con-
servation of energy and the second law of thermodynamics.

who has recently subjected the fragment to 2 detailed examination for a
forthcoming study of Empedocles, has concluded that it is correct.
The experience of defending the opposite view in discussion led me to
make the effort to re-read the lines with a completely open mind, as if
for the first time, and this has finally brought me to see the interpreta-
tion now given here as much the most natural. No doubt obscurities
remain, and the idea of Lave as compressible is not an easy one ta
absorb; but probability lies in that direction.                                    '
   The full case must await the publication of Mr O’Brien’s                            work, but
the points which have chiefly struck me on an unbiased re-reading of
the fragment are these,
   (1) The difficulty of believing that #vipratov PévBos Bivng in v, 3
means the same as foyora TEpporte kGKAOU in #. 10 rather than its anti-
thesis. (This had always troubled my conscience to some extent.)
   (2) The translation of the verbs in v. 10 as if Strife and Love were
passing each other like trains on the up and down lines. &mjer in the
context of Umekmpobéor is much more likely to mean ‘pursued’. (For
UmexTrpoBéw of one pursued cf. 7/ 25.604; Od. 8.125.)
   (3) The difficulty of tenses and sequence of events in yv. 3~5. When
Strife Aad arrived (ixeto) at the dvéprorrov Pévlos, and Love was® in
the middle of the whirl, only then do all things come together gradually
(ouvépxeTan otk &gap).           If this describes the triumph of Love, surely
the process of combination, bringing about and then destroying a world
of living creatures, should be complete.               It seems better to assume that
we are at the opposite point of the cycle, and that the complete separa-
tion of theelements was momentary, as suggested already on p. 178. Once
Strife has reached its furthest extent and confined Love to the very
centre, then there (v Tfi &%, v. 5), i.e. where the unifying power of
Love was, they begin gradually to combine again. I should prefer not
to consider here any further details of Love’s position, for which the
evidence does not exist, but in placing her initially (that is,at the
beginning of her activity) at the centre of the whole mass, from which

union and mother of Eros, and in her turn seems to have owed some-
thing to Pythagorean teaching (pp. 62ff. above).

                                        (1) Cosmogony
That Empedocles omitted any account of cosmogony by combination
in the period of increasing Love is stated by Aristotle (p. 173 above)
and borne out by the silence of the fragments and secondary anthorities.
Of the genesis of our own world, which as in earlier systems was a
pracess of ‘separating-out’, we have some description, though the
doxographers have unfortunately not thought fit to quote much from
Empedocles himself. This is the more tantalizing in that Clement has
preserved the four lines in which he promises to tell of it (fr. 38):
But come now, I shall tell thee the beginning, from which everything that
we now see hecame manifest: earth and billowy sea, the damp atmosphere
and aither the Titan fastening his circle tight round everything.*
The most informative passage is from the Stromateis, and runs as
follows (a30):
Empedacles       of Acragas posits four elements, fire, water, air (either) and
earth, and Love and Strife as their cause.                  He says that air {aer: the Jate

world, and Tivaw cd¢fip (appropriately translated “Sky® by Kahn) the clear hright substance of
outer space. (On Tivav see further pp. 193{. below.) Common Greek speech was content with
the term aiBp, but once the four-element cosmolagy had been put forward, phutosophers differed
over tha question whether it should be identified with air (pure) or fire. Finally ir was established
as a fifth element (vol. 1, z7off.). In Empedocles it is regularly the word for air, which in its
elementa) state was the first to be separated out of the mixture and formed the outer shel] of the
cosmic sphere. (Cf. additional note 1, p. 145.) In the passage from the Stromateis to be discussed
ymmediately,it is clearly distinguished from fire. See further in text.

muxture'     and spread around it in a circle.               After air, fire burst out, and
having nowhere else to go ran out under the solid mass of air.* There are
two    hemispheres revolving round the earth, one endrely of fire and the
other a mixture of air {or mist, aer again] and a little fire. This he supposes
is the night. The start of the revolution is due to the accident that the fire
weighed down and overbalanced the mass.3
   The essential motion initiated by Strife is that of the separation
of the elements from each other and the attraction of like to like
in ever-increasing masses, In Empedocles’s own words (fr. 37): ‘Earth
augments its own body, and air augments air.’ (Cf. als}E fr. 90.)
This however immediately creates a lack of balance in the former
perfectly blended Sphere, and since the mass is still approximately
spherical in shape, the differing weights of the two first elements 10 be
separated out produced in it the rotation which still persists.4 This
rotation has been gradually acceleraring, as is to be expected when one
remembers that it began from the absolute immobility of the Sphere of
Love. Therefore, since the sun is carried round by the motion of the
whole sphere, the days have been gradually growing shorter.
When the human race was first generated from out of the earth, the day was
of the length that ten months are now, owing to the slowness of the sun’s
advance. As time went on, it became the length of seven months (Agt
§.18.1, A75).

The consistency with which Empedocles applies the first principles
of his cosmogony is remarkable. If at all possible he connects their
  ¢ B s    Tpdrms kpdaeas. Though meaning no mare than that air was the firse element o be
separated out of the mixture, the phraseology may afford same slight additional support to the
view, on other grounds reasonable, that Empedocles began his account of the cosmic cycle from
the Sphere of Love,
   * This translation of ol mepl vov &pa wéyau follows Bignone, Emped. 327, n. 2.
   3 Text corrupt. See Bignone, 328, n. 1. But the meaning cannot be other than that fire was
concentrated in the upper hemisphere to begin with, and being heavier than the pure air, caused
the whole sphere to start revolving.

consistent with the mention of the &fw in fr. 35, nor, therefore, the necessity to have recourse, as
Bignone does, to the improbable hypothesis that the 6ivq belongs to a different cosmic period.
Phigersdorfler (Posidonios, 110) points aut correctly enough that the 8ivn is not che ariginal
motion, but occurs only afier the separation of air and fire, The motion originated hy Strife, in
keeping with his character, is one of separatton pure and simple.   Iis further results are accidenta)

application with some phenomenon in the present world, in this case
by a fanciful parallel with the birth of children after seven or ten
months’ gestation.
   The implication that fire is heavier than ‘air’ has been thought
strange, but only because of our habit of equating the four elements of
Empedocles with the four sublunary elements of Aristotle’s five-
element doctrine. In fact, although we use the Aristotelian nomen-
clature, this “air” is for Empedocles, both in name and nature, aither.
The Greeks, owing to their enviable climate, had always made a dis-
tinction between aither, the brilliant upper sky, divine itself and the
abode of divinity, and the dimmer aer at cloud-level and below.? To
the natural philosophers, until the explicit adoption of the five-element
theory, aer was simply oither contaminated with grosser matter such as
moisture. This had to be so for Empedocles, in whose system there
were only four pure elemental substances, and hence when he speaks
of aither he means this bright divine essence which in its purity occupies
(as the account here quoted says) the outermost regions with fire
beneath it. In the terrestrial regions we experience it as atmospheric
air or in even more adulterated forms, but as one of the four ‘roots’ it
might be less misleading to call it ‘ether’. The familiarity of the quartet
fire, water, earth and air makes this impracticable (hence, like Em-
pedocles, ‘I conform to custom myself”), but it is essential to be aware
that this is not the sublunary air of Aristotle. It is an element whose
main mass is more distant from the earth, and nearer the outer confines
of the round universe, than is the main mass of fire. Aérins’s version
of the separation of the elements, which also includes the further stages,
brings out the distinction well (2.6.3, A49):
Empedocles says that the aither {pure elemental air] was first separated off,
fire second, and afier that earth.        From earth, as it was excessively constricted
by the force of the revolution, water gushed out, and from water the aer
[sublunary atmosphere] was evaporated. Theheaven was formed our of aither
and the sun of fire, and from the rest was condensed the terrestrial realm.

   The idea of the crystalline heaven, o familiar in the middle ages and
already hinted atin Parmenides (4 37) and possibly in Anaximenes,” here
becomes explicit. The Stromateis spoke of the ‘solid mass’ (wéyes) of
air, and this is further developed in Agtius. Air, it appears, was
‘frazen’ into solidity hy the action of fire.
Empedocles says that the sky is solid, made of air congealed by fire in the
manner of ice. It encloses fiery and airy substance in each hemisphere
respectively.?                                                                      !
   The apparently bizarre speculations of the early thinkeés are rarely
entirely divorced from observation, but sometimes depend on rather
extravagant extrapolation from it. Thus the hardening action of fire
appears in a more credible form when Empedocles speaks of the drying
out of the earth at the time when it produced the first living creatures:
So then Cypris, after she had moistened the earth with water, as she fashioned
the forms of living things gave them to swift fire to harden.3
Here the goddess plays Prometheus, and is compared to a potter baking
clay figures in the kiln. In fr. 34 the image is that of a baker mixing
flour and water, which again will be hardened into a crust by fire. The
process is similar to that in the cosmogony described by Diodorus
(r.7.2£). The earth ‘was muddy and altogether soft, then first of all
it underwent hardening# as the fite of the sun shone down upon it,
next the heat caused its surface to boil up’, and in this state it produced
the fertile bubhles in which life made its first appearance.                            Somewhat

things is mentioned. They sound as if they referred to the zoogony of the period of increasing
Love. Earth and water, hitherio separated, are being mixed. Under Strife the same effect would
be produced as the water, effectively homogeneons with earth in the Sphere, 15 forced out on
to its surface. For the reading and translanion of eiscat moimviousa see Bignone, 455 5., 206, n. 4.

action of heat formed not only mist but also earth (DK, 6o a1 and 4,
p- 342 below). The strange notion that heat should solidify water as
well as vaporizing it may perhaps receive some illumination from the
Aristotelian Problemata. These base a question on the observed fact
that a deposit crystallizes from the water of hot springs on the rocks
over which it flows. “Why are stones formed by hot water rather than
by cold?. .. The cause of the petrifaction is the heat, just as Empedocles
says that rocks and stones and hot waters are formed.”* The najvers of
Empedocles on this point is somewhat redeemed by the statement which
Plutarchattributes to him (seea69) that rocks have their originin * the fire
that burns in the depth of the earth’. This wins praise from Bignone (p. 72)
as a recognition of the important theory of the plutonic origin of rocks.
Nevertheless to Empedocles their origin from hot water was an equally
logical inference from observation: the essential is the presence of heat.
   To Empedocles the creation of the various contents of the physical
world appeared in general as a process of hardening, solidifying, or
‘setting’. (Cf.n. on previous page) The agent of this ‘setting” was fire,
which no doubt is the reason why Aristotle saw fire as occupying
a special position in his system, over against the other three clements:
(GG, 330b19)          Some, like Empedocles, posit four elements as primary. Yet
he too reduces them to two, for he opposes all the others to fire.
(Metaph. 985a31)       He was the first to say that the material elements are
four, yet he does not employ them as four but as two only, putting fire by
itself and treating the others—earth, air and water—as a single substance.
So one would suppose from a study of his verses.
We find a hint of this special position of fire as agent in the zoogony
of fr. 62 (p. 206 below). Otherwise it is not obvious in the extant
fragments, and Aristotle like the doxographers must have had other
passages in mind. He may also have been inclined to exaggerate its
significance, since he and Theophrastus themselves attached great
importance to the activity of fire and heat in contrast to the passivity of

the other forms of matter. For Empedocles all the elements remained
“equal, coeval, each master in a different province and with its own
character’ (fr. 17.27); but the province of fire was certainly to be active
and creative. In this he had many predecessors.* He was moreover a
native of Sicily, that violent Jand where the soil is baked hard and dry
by the fierce radiance of a sun more African than European, where
by evaporation salt is extracted from the sea commercially in large
quantities,3 and the earth sends up                     fiery lava from          Etna     and    in
several places springs of hot water.

                     (2) Shape of the cosmos
Although the doxographers refer to the cosmos as a sphere, and its
halves as hemispheres, Aétius in one place says that strictly speaking
it was egg-shaped, with its height (distance from earth to sky) less
than its breadth.4 The comparison was probably suggested 10 Em-
pedocles, not by any observed facts, but by the poems of the Orphics,
in whose cosmogony a world-egg gave bicth to the generative power
of Love (Eros—Phanes) before the existence of heaven and earth, which
were subsequently formed from the two balves of the egg.                                        His
religious views are very close to those of the Orphics. The parallel may
have extended to more than the shape.                        In his introduction to the
Phaenomena of Aratus, Achilles writes:
The arrangement which we have assigned to the sphere the Orphics compare
to that in eggs. The sky is analogous to the shell, and as the afeher is sus-
pended in a circle from the heaven, so is the skin (Upfv) from the shell.S

   * Act. 2.31.4 (450). A teanslaton is: ‘Empedocles says thar the height from the earth to the
sky, that is the elevation from ourselves, is less than the dimension in breadth. The heaven ex~
tends further in the latter direction, because the cosmos hes like an egg,” Zeller (ZN, 980, n. 2)
was inclined to take the words & mapamhnolews keioBat as refersing strictly to position only,
claiming that the rest of the descriptian appled better 0 a fartened spheroid. Nestle however
added to the note that in afl probability Empedocles had borrowed the ancient conception of the
world as an egg, a2d the introduction of the word (assuming that it is his) certainly suggests this.
Thar it shiould have precisely the shape of a bird’s egg may not have seemed necessary.

                                 Shape of the Cosmos
This arrangement has a certain resemblance to that of Empedocles’s
cosmos, with sky corresponding to his azther which formed the outer-
most sphere, and aizher to his fire which ‘ran out under the solid mass’
at the circumnference. Empedocles was much impressed by the analogy
between the members or parts of the animal and vegetable world (fr. 82,
- 209 below), and for him and his contemporaries the world itself was
the supreme and universal animal. It is possible that the word ‘crystal-
line’ was used in connexion with eggs (vol. 1, 137), and Leucippus
compared the surface of the round universe to a skin or membrane
(U,       D.L. 9.32).        1t is an interesting if somewhar                 speculative idea
that the long-lived and influential notion of the crystalline sphere (later
spheres) may have owed its origin to the macrocosm—microcosm
analogy and the idea that the universe was essendally an enormous
egg. Whether its outer envelope should be compared to skin or shell
seems to have been something on which the natural philosophers
differed.
   Nothing is recorded of what Empedocles thought about the absolute
size of the cosmos, but he said that the sun is the same size as the earth
and twice as far above the moon as the moon is above the earth. Since
 the orbit of the sun is at the periphery of the cosmos, the vertical radius
 of the cosmos is three times the distance of the moon from the earth.!
 He followed the Pythagoreans in assigning right and left sides ta the
 cosmos, an idea which is bound up with that of the animate nature of
 the universe.?
                         (3) The sun and the rwo hemispheres
 He believed, as did Anaxagoras, that the celestial North Pole was
 originally at the zenith, and that the axis of the universe was later rilted.
 For this, according to Aétius (2.8.2, A58), he gave a mechanical
 explanation:
 credentials of the world-egg as an Orphic conception see Guthrie, Orph. and Gk. Rel. 924, The
 idea occurs in the most widely separated places. In China in Han times an astronomical theory
 was cutrent according to which heaven and earth are shaped like an egig, earth being enclosed by
 the sphere of heaven just as the yolk of an egg is enclosed by its shell (Kramer, Myrhologies of the
 Ane. World, 384, and for an identical conception in Jranian mythology, ibid. 339).
    ¥ Aét. 2.21,2,31.1 (A56and 61). Consistently with this, he said that the sun was larger than
 the moon ¢(D.L. 8.77).

                                        Empedocles
He says that as the aer gave way before the onrush of the sun [i.e. the dark
hemisphere hefore that of the light; see below], the poles® were tilted, so that
the northern parts were heightened and the southern lowered, and the whole
universe affected similarly.
   Still relying on the secondary sources, we learn that the stars are
‘fiery, made from the fiery element which the air contined within
itself and squeezed out at the first separation’. They are not, therefore,
as they were for Xenophanes, the result of exhalations from earth-level,
a difference which seems to reflect the different religious obitlook of the
two men. The fised stars are imbedded ‘in the crystal’, but the planets
move freely.
   The sun is also commonly described as being of fire. Diogenes
(8.77) calls it ‘a great concentration of fire’, and Agtivs (2.6.3, A49)
says that as the elements separated the sky was farmed of aither and the
sun of fire. Only the Stromateis (a30) say that ‘the substance of the
sun is not fire, but a reflexion of fire like that from water’, Each of
these sources is perhaps over-simplifying the case. Aétius in another
passage (2.20.13, A56) credits Empedocles with a complex                                theory
about the sun which is not altogether easy to understand.3
Empedocles assumes two suns: (1) the archetype, which is fire in one hemi-
sphere of the cosmos.         It fills the hemisphere, and is always stationed op-
posite its own reflexion; (2) the visible sun.           This is a reflexion in the other
hemisphere, namely the hemisphere which is filled with air {or darkness, aer]
mixed with heat. It arises by reflexion from the earth—which is circulart—
on to the crystal-like sun, and is carried round with it by the mouon of the
fire. In brief, the sun is a reflexion of the fire surraunding, the earch.
   This may be supplemented by a further sentence of Agtius (2.21.2,
A56) that ‘the sun-by-reflexion is equal to the earth’, and a line of
    * 7&s perovs, the north and south poles. C. Anst, Meseor. 3623 32, # Eripa dpros of

                      The Sun and the Two Hemispheres
Empedocles himself which is quoted in passing in Plutarch’s De
Pych. or. (4a0b, see Empedacles fr. 44): ‘You laugh at Empedacles
for saying that the sun, originating about the earth by reflexion
of light from          the sky, “flashes back             to Olympus          with     fearless
countenance”.’
   In the absence of the ariginal it is unlikely that we can reproduce his
theory with certainty from these partial and distorted data,                              Most
probably the sun (in the ordinary accepted use of the word) is a
reflexion of the whele fiery hemisphere thrown back on to it in some
way from the earth. When the Stromareis, to emphasize that it is only
a reflexion, say that it is not itself fire, they falsify Empedocles, since
for him a reflexion consisted of effuences of particles from an object,
collected and packed together on the reflecting surface; that is, they are
of the same material as the object itself.* The term enaklasis (bending
back, re-flexion) was used not only of reflected light or images, but also
in connexion with the use of convex mirrors as burning-glasses,* and
this is obviously what was in Empedocles’s mind here. The whole
bright fiery hemisphere shines on to the earth, where its light and fire
are collected into a focus and then thrown back as a ‘great concentra-
tion3 of fire’, as Diogenes has it, to form the sun. The daily revolution
of the sphere carries the sun round with it. 1tis natural that Empedocles
should have been neither accurate nor very clear about the Jaws govern-
ing the direction of reflexions. This fits most of the testimony, including
any hints that we have in the fragments of the poem itself. Thus in
fr. 41 it is said of the sun that ‘when gathered [or massed, &hiofei)
together he circles round the great heaven’. Kranz with some plaust-
bility takes fr. 44, that the sun ‘fashes back to Olympus with fearless
countenance’, introduced by Plutarch with the remark that it originates
by reflexion of light from the sky, together with fr. 38.4 (quoted
abave, p. 185), as being the lines which                    together gave        tise to the
‘two-sun’ description           of Aétius.     ‘Titan’ suggests a reference             to the

   * Aet. 4.34.1 (a88). The point is made by Millerd, Emped, o8,

sun,’and at the same time it is the aither which circumscribes all things.
This is the fire-filled half of the crystalline hemisphere considered as
‘archetypal’ sun, whereas what ‘flashes back to Olympus’ (that is
to the sky, identical with ‘ aizher the Titan") is what we call the sun, the
dazzling and burning concentration thrown back from the earth.
   1t is incredible that this theory should not be in some way connected
with the Pythagorean ideas about the sun attributed to Philolaus.?
Philolaus was the younger man, but one cannot be certain about the
chronological relationship of the two theories. Both were] of course
known to Theophrastus, on whom Aétius, our immediate source for
both, will have been relying, and from what is said of the Philolaic
view in particular one may judge that he thought them rather absurd.
His suggestion that it might even imply a third sun is only a captious
criticism, and it is possible that the talk of ‘two suns’ is also a matter of
interpretation and that he had rather lightly thrown the two theories
together.     They      could not have been              identical, since Empedocles’s
scheme lacked the central fire of the Philolaic, and it may be a confusion
here that led Aétius to speak of the sun as reflected in the other, dark
hemisphere. This is the hemisphere of night, nor is it easy to see how
in that case, if it originated from the fiery hemisphere, it could be
reflected off the earth. Millerd tried to meet the objection that if the sun
were in this hemisphere it would be bright day, by saying that ‘fire is
not perceived unless it approaches the eye. It may be spread out in the
heavens through the whole hemisphere that encircles us without our
percetving it. 1t may travel from one hemisphere to the other in large
quantities without coming to us.’3 Even if this were correct, the idea
  * Kranz makes this point in Philologus, 1961, 290—5. Titan itself as a name for the sun does not
elsewhere occur until the Christian era, when it is frequent in poetry, but he nevertheless is a
Titan, namely Hyperion, as early as Homer (/2 15.398; Od. 1.24) as well as in later classical
wricees, Alternaavely heis the san of Ticaas (Theia and Hyperion in Hes. T4, 371-4; Hyperian,
ibid. vor1, Od. 12,1765 Hom. Hymn Dem. 26).
  * See vol. 1, 284f. To make a small additional point, both used the name Olympus for the
highest heaven. Cf. Empedocles, fr. 44 (quoted in text) and Philolaus x16. Diels (SBB, 1884,
353) thought thar the origin of the reflexion-theory of the sun was jncomprehensible without
presupposing the reflexion from Philolaus’s centra) fire.

that the hemisphere of fire could be the nocturnal one, because the fire
in it escapes our eyes, is disptoved by the Stromureis (a30), which
state that not the fiery hemisphere but the hemisphere of aer ‘mixed
with a little fire’ (presumably the stars) ‘is the night’. It is also in-
compatible with frr. 48 and 49 of Empedocles himself, in the setting in
which they are presented.
Fr. 48 (Plut. Qu. Plar. 1006f): The pointers of sundials by staying still and
not changing their place with the shadows become instruments and measures
of time, like the earth which intercepts the sun when the sun passes below it,
as Empedocles says:
   ¢ The earth makes night by blocking the lights.”
Fr. 49 (Plut. Qu. conv. 720€): The aer being dark (as Empedocles says,
                  “belonging to lonely, blind-eyed” night”)
gives back through the ears what it takes away from sight of the power of
perceiving ahead.
Fr. 49 substantiates the statement of the Stromateis that the hemisphere
of aer is that of night, and fr. 48 shows that Empedocles believed the
dark effect of the nocturnal hemisphere to be ensured by the screening
off of the sun’s light by the earth. It has been claimed as an advance
on his part that by attributing night to the shadow of the earth he had
outgrown the earlier idea that darkness was a substance in itself, 2
kind of mist or exhalation.? In fact however night was still a sky-ful
of aer, and the part played by the earth’s interposition was simply to
ensure that the darkness of this substance was not counteracted by
movement of the light, That light takes t1me to0 wravel is an anticipation of modern knowiedge,
but for Empedocles it followed naturally from his view that light is a material substance ‘Howing
from the light-giving body’ (Philop. De an. 334.34, A57). 1t is stated by Aristotle, loc, cit.:
‘Empedocles, and any other who says the same, are wrong in speaking of light as travelling and
being at 2 given moment becween the earth and the surrounding sphere’; and again De sensu,
446326.
   On the other hand Millerd does draw attention to something generally overlooked: not onty
does Aétius say that the sun is a reflexion in the darker hemisphere, but Plucarch (De facie, 922.¢,
AGo) speaks canversely of people who grumble ac Empedacles for making the moon a solidifica
tion of air surraunded by the sphere of fice. Lcannot claim to understand from diis what Empe-
docles himself said, but it certainly does not explans how the sun could be a reflexion from the
dark sphere, on Millerd’s view or any other.

illumination from the light hemisphere. The only reasonable conclusion
(in which we have many predecessors, for example Tannery, Gilbert,
Heath, Burnet) is that the report of Aétius is mistaken, either because
he paraphrased          Theophrastus          unintelligently        or, more        probably,
because Theophrastus himself gave an ironically confused account of
what were to him archaic and unscientific theories.®
   A farther report about the sun is: “The sun turns because it is pre~
vented by the sphere surrounding it, and by the tropic cirgles, from
continuing for ever on a straight course’ (Aét. 2.23.3, 458).                            1As ofien,
the doxographer seems to have indiscriminately combined two state-
ments. That the sun’s course is regulated by the inner surfape of the
sphere seems aimed at the bizarre theory of Xenophanes (a472) that a
series of suns succeed one another, travelling on indefinitely in a
straight line. How Empedacles conceived of the tropic cirdles, and in
what way they could prevent the sun’s further passage North or South,
is not said. It is presumably connected with his explanation of the
seasons, which is sald to have been that ‘it is winter when the aer
through condensation predominates and is forced into the upper part,
and summer as fire predominates whenever it is forced into the lower.”
That is, in winter the darkness which fills one half of the cosmic sphere
overflows into the fiery half, and in summer the fiery half encroaches
on the dark. “The idea seems to be that the greater half of the sphere
takes longer to revolve about a particular point on the earth’s surface
than the smaller half, and that this explains why the days are longer in
the summer than in the winter’ (Heath, Ariszarchus, 88).                        But no reason
is given for the successive encroachments. They could have been a
kind of tidal effect caused by the cosmic whirl, which was in its origin
due to a certain lack of equilibrium between the dark and the bright
spheres.
   Amid so much that seems pure imagination, it is refreshing 1o recall
that Empedocles was aware of the true cause of eclipses. The sun is

eclipsed ‘when the moon passes beneath it’, says Aétius. He may have
learned this from the Pythagoreans, for Aétius attributes the same
explanation to bath; but these Jater attributions of astronomical dis-
coveries are very uncertain, and for Empedocles we have his own words.
“The moon’, says Plutarch, ‘often conceals and obliterates the sun.
As Empedocles says: “She cuts off his rays as he passes above her, and
darkens as much of the earth as is the breadth of the pale-eyed moon.” 't
Altogether, in spite of their fanciful aspects, his theories about the sun
are considerably more advanced and subtle than those of Heraclitus
and Xenophanes, with their suns lost and replaced every day and their
extraordinary ideas about eclipses. Unlike them, he gives the impression
of a man who wants to come to grips with the problems of nature for
their own sake,
                                          (4) The moon
His views about the moon                    are thus      stated in the account of the
Stromateis (A30):
He says that the moon was formed separately of the aer cut off by the fire,
which solidified like hail. It has its light from the sun.
Aétus says that it is ‘compacted air, resembling cloud, solidified by
fire, so that it is a compound’, and Plutarch describes it as ‘a solidifica~
tion of air resembling hail’. Its shape was that of a disc or lentil, that
is, round with convex sides, not spherical? The evidence that Em-
pedocles knew it to be lit from the sun is stronger than that for Par-
menides. He imitated the punning line of Parmenides that called it a
“foreign light’3 and Plutarch quates another original verse in the
following context:
There remains then the theory of Empedocles that the moonlight which we
see comes from the moon’s reflexion of the sun. That is why there is nejther

 of his explanation of the phases or eclipses of the moon, though Heath
(Aristarchus, 91) suggested that its ‘mixed’ composition      pnight be
intended to account for the former. The description makes its forma-
tion identical with that of the outermost sphere as also given by
Aégtius (A 51), which may be why the Stromareis takes the trouble to
add the word ‘separately” (kaf” tourhyv).

                                          (5) The earth
Nothing has survived about the shape of the earth,? and it is uncertain
whether he believed it to be spherical. Neither Anaxagoras nor Demo-
critus did so, and the implication of Aétius that the axis of the cosmos
was originally perpendicular to the earth’s surface suggests that this
was flat: the two ideas are combined in Anaxagoras.3                        It remains in the
centre of the universe not because it is supported by air or anything
else, nor yet because, as Anaximander so ingeniously suppased, it has
no reason to move in one direction rather than another, but by the
action of the cosmic whirl.
Some, like Empedocles [says Aristotle], say that the motion of the sky as it
rotates in a circle at a higher speed [sc. than would be the earth’s in falling]
prevents the earth from moving. Itis like the water in cups, which when the
cup is swung round in a circle does not fall though it is often underneath the
bronze and it is natural for it to move downwards. The reason is the same.4

depths ate dmripove (fr. 303 of. vol. 1, 3943
  3 For Anixagoras sec pp. 30§, 110 below; cf. alsa vol. t, 294, and for Parmenides p. 64 above.

demonstraton of centrifugal force by means of the rapidly whirled cup of water is not in fact
relevant to the case of the earth. A good appreciation of Empedocles’s merits and limitatons

                         The Moon: the Earth: the Sea
This is one example out of several which indicate a genuine desire on the
partof Empedocles to hase his conclusions about the natural world on ob-
servation, evenifat that early stage of science theinference was inaccurate,
Like theillustrations of the lantern (fr. 84) and the clepsydra (fr. 100), itis
simply a matter of drawing analogies from well-known phenomena, not
of controlled experiment. The trick with the rotating cups will have been
pat of the stock-in-trade of jugglers at fairs, as Gomperz tells us it still
is (or was in his lifetime).
                                         (6)   The sea
The sea is water originally contained within the eirth, which burst out
as the earth was squeezed like a sponge by the force of the cosmic
whitl. In some way the heat of the sun was combined with this as a
causal factor, thus enabling Empedocles to invoke the microcosm—
macrocosm analogy, which for him was very real. The sea was ‘the
sweat of the earth’ (fr. §5), exuded under heat, and, like other sweat,
salt. Aristotle (Meceor. 357a24) dismissed this as a ridiculous and
meaningless metaphor, but for Empedocles it was more than that. The
sea was not entirely salt however, but contained .an imperceptible
quantity of fresh water, which produced nourishment for fish.r
   Certain features of this cosmology of Empedocles make it fairly
clear that he had studied Parmenides’s world of seeming no less than
his way of truth. The rwo hemispheres, one of fire and 1he other of
aer mixed with a little fire, suggest a derivation from the circular bands,
here is given by Gomperz, Gr, TA.1, 242. Mugler (Dev. Cy<l, 37) thinks that Aristode may have
been misled by the poetic diction of Empedocles, who intended to describe something different,
namely the behaviour of a solid body floating w a liquid contained in 2 cykndical ar spherical
vessel. Cherniss on the ather hand (4CP, 204, . 234) says that the simile must have been intended
1o explain, not why the earch does not fall, but why the outer water, air and fire do not fall upon
the earth. He refers to Heidel, Heroic Age of Seience, 188. This would form a parallel to the theory
of Anaxagoras (p. 302 below); the only doubt is whether such a gross misunderstanding of
Empedocles was possible,
    The doxographic notices are: (@) Aét. 2.6.3 (A49) ‘From earth as it was excessively con-
stricted by the force of the revolution, the water gushed out’; () idem 3.16.3 (a66) *Empedo-
cles calfs the sea the sweat of the earth, as it was scorched by the sun owing ta the increasing
compression’. Tzetzes (see 466) has a pictruresque description of the chaotic state of things when
the world was young: “ According to Empedocles the natural philosopher, the elements were still
in disorderly motion even after the appearance of earth and sea: at one time fire would get the
upper hand and burn things up, and at another the surge of water would overflow and submerge
them.” On the fresh water in 1he sea, Aehan, Nat. an. 9.64 (466), p. 247 below, and for the
same beliefin Democritus see p 424,

one made of rare matter, another of dense, “and others between these
mixed of light and darkness’. The moon, too, for Parmenides, was a
compound of both aer and fire. (See 437, pp. 61f. above.)

             XK.   THE    FORMATION             OF    LIVING        CREATURES

We have already seen how in general, ‘chemical’ terms the' various
forms of life arise. What is truly existent cannot be born or perish or
change, but strictly speaking only the four elementary substances exist:
life resules from mixtures of these substances in certain proportions.
According to the stage in the cosmic cycle at which it occuts, a thing
may both be born and perish by either the coming together or the
dissolution of the elements (fr. 17.3—5).                   Into this new framework are
fitted the current ideas (going back to Anaximander, and in mytho-
logical form further stilt) of life as originating in moistened earth under
the action of heat.          So in fr. 73 Love, the agent of mixture, mingles
earth with water, fashions the living creatures in it, and hardens them
by fire. Fr. 62 describes a similar process.
   The evolution of animal life was related to the cosmic cycle in a way
shar can be seen from a passage of Aétius supplemented by quotations
from Empedocles and other testimony. The doxographer does not
make it clear, as he was probably not clear himself, that he was describ-
ing, not a continuous evolution, but two contrary processes.                               Never-
theless the passage can be read as a concise summary of the Empedoclean
dactrine. 1t distinguishes four stages as follows.?
   * Bignone (Emped. 427) has shown it to be probable that frr. 34 and 73 should be joined as the
two halves of a simile. [*As a baker puts cakes in the oven], having cemented the meal with
water, so Cypris after she had moistened the earth with water, as she fashioned the forms of
living things gave them to swift fire 1o harden.” The custom of making cakes in the form of
animals and men would add pownt 10 the simile. Another simile describing the work of Lave
in forming compounds 15 fr. 33: ‘As when fig-juice fixes and binds white milk.' Fig-juice was
used as rennet, and the line is adapted from Homer, JZ §.90z. Here 1t may have a more par-
ticular physiolagical reference; f. Plut. Qu. naz. 9172 (478): ‘Some say that sears are ¢xcruded
like whey from milk when the blood is stirred up; so Empedocles.’
   * AgL §.19.5 (A72). The passage has been the subject of considerable discussion, but since it
seems to admis of a straightforward interpretation references to ather views would be more likely
to cloud the issue than 1o clarify it. To mention only one of the most recent, Minar in Phronesis,
1963, 14f,, supposes all four stages in Agtius 1o be contained within the period of increasing
Love.   But his assumption that to do otherwise involves canfining sexual generation entirely to
the epoch of Strife places an entirely undeserved reliance on the completeness of the doxographer’s
summary. At the same time he has to explain the absence of information about the period of
increasing Surife as due at least in part to “the fragmentary natuxe of our wradition” (p. 143).

                       The Formation of Living Creatures
Empedocles says (i) the first generations of plants’ and animals were not
entire, bur divided, with parts not grown together; (i) the second, in which
the parts grew together, were like creatures of fantasy; (iif) the third was the
generation of the whole-natured; (iv) the fourth was no longer engendered
from the elements? like earth and water but from each other, when for some
their nourishment became thick and for others the beauty of women excited
the seminal motion.?           The     kinds of all living creatures        were distributed
according to the character of their mixture: some had a more natural inclina-
tion to water, as many as had a preponderance of fire flew up into the air,¢
the heavier made for the earth, and those in whose composition the elements
were equally balanced....5

   (i) This is the earliest stage of organic life in the period when Love
is gaining and the process of evolution is from separation 16 combina~
tion. Empedocles describes it in the lines of fr. 57, which is expressly
ascribed by Aristotle to this period and by Simplicius to the first
stage of it:6
On the earth? many heads sprang up without necks, arms wandered bare,
bereft of shoulders, and eyes strayed alone in need of foreheads.

                                          Empedocles
This provides concrete illustrations of the fantastic situation ourlined
in fr. 20, taken from Simplicius (Phys. 1124.9):
Here too [sc. in the sublunary world] Empedocles says that Strife and
Love prevail in turn among men and fish and beasts and birds, when                                  he
writes:
   *This is manifest throughout the mass of mortal bodies. At one time all
the limbs which belong to the body, in the prime of blooming life, come
together into one through Love. At another, severed by evil spirits of dis-
cord, they wander, each separately, on the shores of life; and it i§ the same
for bushes, and fishes housed in water, and beasts with their mountain lairs
and birds of winged flight.”

   Aristotle’s criticism amplifies the picture slightly (G4 722bY7):
Tt is impossible for large members                to survive and be alive in separation,
which is Empedocles’s account of generation under Love. ‘Many heads’, he
says, ‘ grew up without necks', and later they were joined together.?
Simplicius, in describing with the aid of fr. 35.9—13 the state of things
when Love was gaining but Strife still active and vigorous, adds:
In this state of things the members were still * single-Jimbed’ (formed of one
limb only]® from the separation wrought by Strife, and wandered abour
longing to combine with each other.

    * This fr. is given a different application by Bignone, Emped. 410, but the interpretation of
Diuels, which he stigmatizes as erroneous, is more likely 1o be right (at least in its general reference
to the evolutionary cycle, if not in detaif). Bignone’s objection to it (571, n. x) is that it includes
plants among the organisms whose parts once sprang up separately and were joined at random,
whereas Aristotle in a baaeering moad says that Empedocles should have mentioned ‘olive-
headed vines” as well as *man-headed oxen’ (Phys. 199b 10), and Simplicius ad Joe. (382.30)
confirms that he left them out. Ir is however scareely possible, considering his elaborate striving
after consistency, that Empedacles fatled to assurme the same process for plants as for animals,      If
he confined himself to a general reference like the above, Acistotle was still entitled to have his
joke about the man who specified the animal monsters (which were already well known in Greek
mythological tradition) but did not dare ta enumerace the surprising products of his scheme in the
plant wosld. The inclusion of plants by Aétius is some confirmation that this was so, Itis difficulr
to believe, as Bignone would have us do, that the words of fr. 20 describe the individual in health
and sickness. Still more improbable is the propoesition of Kranz, advanced without argument
{ Emped. 361), that the subject of these lines is sexual intercourse.
   * Bignone (Emped. §69) sees here an affinity between Empedacies and the Orphic doctrine
cited by Acistotle, G4, 734216, that the parts of animals come into being not simultaneously but
one after the other, ‘like the weaving of a net’, There however Aristotle js referting to the forma~
tion of the foetus in the womb, not to Empedacles’s fantastic theory of the origin af Iife in another
part of the cosmic cycle.
   ? See fr. 8 The compound adjective wowouhii is clearly Empedecles’s.

                   Living Creatures under Advancing Love
       “But when daimon engaged more and more with daiman’,’
as Love continued to gain over Strife,
   ‘it came to pass both that these things* came together as each happened
to meet, and also many others besides them sprang up in continuous suc-
cession” (fr. 59).
This fragment must have been written in close proximity to 35.16f.
And as they [the elements] mingled, a myriad kinds of mortal creatures were
brought forth, endowed with all sorts of shapes, a wonder 1o behold.
The chance coming together of the separate limbs and organs marks the
transition to the second stage. Similarly, Simplicius says elsewhere
(PPys. 371.33) that under the rule of Love, first the parts of animals
such as heads, hands and feet appeared here and there at random, tken
they came together and gave rise to the monsters about to be described.
    (i) For the second stage of Love’s advance we have four surviving
lines of Empedocles (fr. 61):
Many were born with faces and breasts hoth front and back, oxen with the
heads of men, and conversely there sprang up creatures in human form with
the heads of oxen, and mixtures partly of men and partly of women’s nature,
fitted with shadowed3 [private] parts.
Plutarch preserves, along with the man-headed oxen, another phrase
(fr. 60): ‘shambling [cattle] with countless hands’.4
    It is at this stage that we have the theory of the survival of the
fittest which some modern commentators have likened to Darwin’s.
No words of Empedocles on the subject have survived. Aristotle refers
to it briefly in a passage where he is setting forth, in order to refute it,
   ¥ That is, as the struggle between Love and Strife continued and intensified. The comments
interpolated by Simplicius show that he ac least thought that they (not, as Zeller supposed, the
elements) are the Safpoves in question. For pioyeofo of engaging in combat cf. e.g. Hom. 77 4.456.
   ? ‘Dieses’ in the translation of DK should be ‘Diese”.
   3 Or “sterile’. Diels suggested amelpois, a probable conjecture.
   4 eikfrose. The epithet is a standing one for cattle, and cattle only, in Homer. Tn the same
meaning it occurs Jater without the noun in Theocritus 25.131. M. Timpanare Cardini (Physis,
1960, 8) thinks that by éxprréxapx Empedocles did not mean “with innumerable hands’ but “with
hands not articulated into separate fingers’, suitable appendages for mixed animal and human
creatutes. This is probable. The word is presumably modelled on the Homeric dwpiréguiios
and &xpitéguvos.    The former (JZ 2. 868) undoubredly means that the leaves were plentiful, but
 does so by calling them *indistinguishable’. (Lieselotte Solmsen in Lex. d. frikgr. Epos, s.v.:
 ‘mit meht zu unterscheidenden, dichten Blattern.”) dxpirépeovos is applied to the speech of
 ‘Thersites in 7/, 2. 246, Where confusion rather than profusion seems to be in point.

                                         Empedocles
the anti-teleological view according to which any apparent signs of
purpose in nature (e.g. that front teeth should be sharp for biting, and
the molars flat to reduce the food to a digestible smoothness) are in
fact only fortuitous.
Similarly [he continues (Pfys. 198 b27)] with other organs in which we seem
to see a purpose. Where everything turned out in a way which simulated
purpose, those creatures survived because 8y chance they were constituted in
a suitable way; whereas all that were not so constituted perished, and con-
tinue to perish, as Empedocles says the ‘man-headed oxen’ d(:d.
   Commenting on this passage, Simplicius is rather more !\nformative.
After quoting fr. 62, vv. 2~3, he continues (Phys. 371.33):
Empedocles says that during the rule of Love first of all there came into
being at random parts of animals such as heads, hands and feet, and then
there came together those ‘oxen with the heads of men’, *and conversely
there sprang up’, naturally, ‘men with the heads of oxen’, that is, com-
pounded of ox and man. Asmany of these parts as were fitted together
in such a way as to ensure their preservation became animals and survived,
because they fulfilled mutual needs—the teeth tearing and softening food,
the stomach digesting it, and the liver converting it into blood. The human
head, when it meets a human body, ensures the preservation of the whole,
but being inappropriate to the ox-body it leads to its disappearance. All that
did not come together according to the proper formula [logos] perished.
   Whatever         the    superficial     resemblances         of    this   conception         to
nineteenth-century theories of evolution, it was obviously reached
   * They were probably rated most highly by Gomperz, Gr. Thinkers, 1, 244, We mnst at least
agree that they represent an attempt to explain the apparent evidence of design in nature by
purely natural, or, as the Greeks would say, ‘necessary’ causes, This reliance on blind automatism
and neglect of the final cause in Empedocles is repeatedly castigated by Aristotle. That is the
intention of his criticism at Phys. 199bg. Cf. also 196a20—5, GC, 313b15, Metaph. 1000b12,
De caelo, 300b25-30, PA, 610219, De resp. 473215.
   Fora sceptical view see Millerd, Emped. 58, She thought that Simplicius was mistakenly attri-
buting to Empedocles a view which Aristotle assigned ta athers, with only a purely incidental
mention of Empedocles. This is perhaps a possible way of reading Phys. 193b27, but T do not
think it a likely one, especially in view of his criticism of Empedocles on the same ground else-
where. Nor do I see the force of Zeller’s remark (ZN, 989, n. 3), approved by Millerd, that an
evolutionary theory based on chance could not appear until the teleolagical explanation had been
developed which it was intended to replace. Rather was the philosophic (as opposed to naive
mythological) expression of teleology developed by Socrates, Plato and Aristotle as a deliberate
attack on the automatism of earlier science. Luria, dnft d. gr. Denkens, 1963, 153, n. 208, also
takes an extreme sceptical view, but for a different assessment see M. Timpanaro Cardini in
Physis, 1960.

from very different premises and formed an integral part of a cosmo-
logical system which by nineteenth-century standards was fanciful in
the extreme. It does not refer to development in the present wotld,
but to an era in which evolution proceeded in the opposite direction.
The monsters         described are reminiscent of various figures in Greek
mythology, and it is fair to assume that Empedocles had these in mind,
for he was always glad to show that his carefully constructed system
accounted for phenomena known or believed in by his countrymen.
The Minotaur provided a bull-headed man, and other mixed forms
included centaurs and the Chimaera (lion’s head, goat’s body, and
serpent’s tail). Bisexual beings were by no means confined to Herma-
phroditos, whose cult seems to have been introduced at Athens during
the fifth century. Considering the affinities of Empedocles’s doctrines,
some have been tempted to think also of Phanes, in Orphic literature
the creator and first ruler of the gods and the world. Orphic verses
described himn as bisexual and as having the heads of a ram, a bull, a
lion and a snake.® Butalthough Phanes himself might be said to belong
to the past, in so far as a god can (he was swallowed by Zeus), it is
hardly likely that Empedacles would have wished to include this great
cosmic figure among the transient non-viable creatures which his lines
describe. More obviously in the same tradition (whatever its origin)
are the early human beings comically described by Aristophanes in
Plato’s Symposium (189dff.). These were spherical in shape and in
every way double, with four hands, legs and ears, two faces, and the
sexual parts of both male and female.?
  ' See Guthrie, Orph. and Gk. Rel. 1o1f. and 145, nn. 24 and 25, for evidence for this paragraph.
  * Some have thought that they resemble rather the olhogusis of the early stages of Swrife’s
progress. The ‘wholeness’ of their androgynous nature, and their spherical shape, can be thought
o paint in this direction, and their modification into ordinary men and wornen was the result of a
drastic act of separation. Also it can be argued that the otdopueis, assuming that they were bio-
logically sufficiently advanced in the first place, would lead happier and better lives than our-
selves, since Love was more powerful then than now; and the Aristophanic hermaphrodites
were happier than their monosexual successors,
  Qn the other hand, (3) Aristophanes’s creatures have even more limbs and sexual paris than
we do, whereas the otiogueis have none; (2) bisexual beings occur among the monsters of fr. 613
(3) in Empedocles the human beings of an age when Love was more powerful were not only
happy but morally perfect and pious worshippers, whereas Aristophanes’s creatures were so
impious that they tried to scorm heaven and attack the gods. Plato’s mind was well stocked with
traditional motifs, but it is unwise to look 100 ¢losely at the tale which an imaginative genius puts
into the mouth of one of the greatest of comic poets. 1 cannot myself believe that the ottogusis
70mar had any kind of human form.      Cf. p. 211 below.

                                         Empedocles
   From fr. 61 and the comments of Aristotle and Simplicius it follows
that there was a third stage in the period of increasing Love, not men-
tioned by Aétius: when the monstrosities had been weeded out by
natural causes, there remained men, women and animals who were the
counterpart of those in our own era.r Since Love unites heterogeneous
elements, it is presumably to this stage that Aristotle refers when he
says that ‘the hottest animals, those containing most fire, ate aquatic,
to escape the excess of heat in their own nature’.* This is the contrary
of what is said at the end of the Aétius passage (p. 201 above), that
animals seek the element most akin to the one which preponderates in
themselves. That applies to the present era of increasing\Strife, in
which each element is attracted 1o its like.
   (iif) The third stage mentioned by Agtius is an early stage in the
advance of Strife. ' Whole-natured’ (or growing as a whole, oUAoguris)
is the word used by Empedocles himself in the following description
(fr. 62):
Come now and hear this, how fire as it was separated raised up the nocturnal3
scions of men and pitiable women: it is no erring or ignorant tale. Whole-
patured forms first sprang up from the earth, having a portion of both water
and heat. These the fire sent vp, wishing to come to its like. Not yet did
they display the comely shape of limbs, nor voice nor the part proper to
men.

fire in the earth reaching outwards towards the large mass of fire at the
circumference of the cosmos. In this process curious living forms arise
compounded of earth mixed with water and fire, without limbs, organs,
or distinction of sex. The unifying force of Love is still strong.? The
fourth element of air is not mentioned (so Bignone suggested) because
air is a component of blood and fleshy tissue {fr. 98) which these living
masses do not yet possess.? It could be absorbed later from the sur-
rounding atmosphere.            It is likely enough that Empedocles took these
pains to impose consistency on his scheme, but in the choice of the
three elements he would also be influenced by ancient traditions of the
origins of life. In Hesiod (&7ga, 59ff.) Zeus ordered the god of fire to
mix earth and water to make the first woman.                        For Anaximander life
arose from water and earth when they were heated. In Empedocles
fire retains the active role, as its heat penetrates the mixture.
    The general notion of earth as literally the mother, from within
whom not only plants but also the first animals and men originated,
is of course so old and universal as hardly to need illustration. Among
the Greeks it is reflected in myths like that of Cadmus and the ‘sown
men’    of Thebes, of Jason sowing the dragon’s teeth, of many                              auto-
chthonous heroes and gegeneis (earthborn), of Deucalion and the re-
newal of the human race after the flood from *the bones of our mother’
(i.e. stones). Tales of the marriage of earth and sky symbolize the need
of water to make earth fertile. Serious beliefs in the spontaneous genera-
tion of small animals like mice from the earth were buttressed by the
conviction that the earth had in the past possessed even greater
generative powers.3
   (iv) The fourth stage, a later one in the advance of Strife, is that in
which we now live.            Advancing discrimination and articulation have
brought into being the familiar world of self-reproducing male and
female creatures, divided into fishes, birds and land-animals.                          Love of

though Hippolytus says that their intercourse is the work      of Swife (see Ref. 7 29.22, 30.4,

course is stll at work, but her power is weakening, and with the
effect of this in the human sphere we pass from the poem on nature to
the Purifications, which tells of the moral degeneration brought about
by increasing Strife. The remark in Aétius about women’s beauty may
be compared with a line of Empedocles which as printed in DK speaks
of the desire that comes upon a man through sight (fr. 64, quoted by
Plutarch in connexion with sexual love).!
   What Empedocles said about trees may fittingly find a Place here,
for besides having a considerable general interest, it shows them as a
kind of living fossil, a primitive form of life which has persi’?ted to the
present day.        Afrius paraphrases it thus (5.26.4, a70):
Empedocles says that trees were the first living things® to grow‘out of the
earth, before the sun was spread around? and day and night were distinguished.
Owing to the matching of the elements in their mixture, they corbined the
formula for male and female. They grow by being pushed up by the heat in
the earth, so that they are parts of the earth just as embryos in the belly are
paris of the womb. Fruits consist of the excess of water and fire in the plants.
Those that have insufficient moisture lose their leaves in summer as it
evaporates, but those that have more, like the laurel, clive and palm, retain
them.¢ Differences in flavour are due to the composition of the soil, and the
different ways in which the plants draw the homoeomerous substances from
that which nourishes them.5             So with vines, it is not the differences in the
vine that make a drinkable wine, but differences in the soil that sustains
them.
  * See Plut. Qu. Phys. g17c. The reference to sight is due to a conjecture by Wyttenbach.
Cataudella (Riv. d: filol. 1960, 128£.) suggests a reading closer to the MSS,, but [ find the allusion
to the aphrodssiac effects of the digestive process more in keeping with Catullan impudence (he
quotes Catullus 32.9 as a parallel) than with the present context. In any case Plucarch quotes the

regularly and so in sufficient quantity. Since the food is drawn from the earth in the form of
moisture, the two explanations are complementary. Plutarch’s describes the mechanism whereby
the evergreens obtain their larger supply of moisture.

                                  The Nature of Trees
    Trees, then, are the nearest in the present world to the original
‘whole-natured’ forms of life. Like them they are still rooted in the
earth, from which they are pushed up by the heat within it, and sdll
combine the characteristics of both sexes, because the persistent in-
fluence of Love combines their elements in a manner nearer to the per-
fect mixture of the Sphere than that of more recent formations.
    A further point of interest in the account is the analogy between
vegetable and animal life. The doxographer applies to trees the word
(3%«) usually confined to animals, probably because it appeared in
Empedocles. For him, with his belief in the kinship of all life, there was
no firm distinction. One may compare his own expression ‘tall olive-
trees bear eggs’ (fr. 79), the assertion in fr. 82 that hair, leaves, scales
and the wings of birds are ‘the same’, and the description of the ear as
a ‘shoot (or sprout, &305) of flesh’ (Theophr. De sensu 9, 486). Accord-
ing to the De plantis both heand Anaxagoras attributed desire, pleasure
and pain to plants, and the latter, as well as Democritus and Plato,
called them ‘earth-rooted animals’.* The paralle]l between young plants
and embryos is echoed in the Hippocratic treatise On the Nature of the
Child (277, viL. 528 Littré):
All things that grow in the eacth live off the moisture in the earth, and the
moisture in them depends on the moisture in it.* So also the child lives off
its mother in the womb, and its health depends on hers. If anyone considers
what has been said on this subject from beginning to end, he will find a
similarity between the whole nature of the products of the earth and those
of human generation.

These remarks may               owe     something        to Empedocles,          but are more
reasonably taken as arising out of the old and very general belief in
the earth as the original mother of all living things alike. The same
analogy is turned into nonsense by Aristophanes in the Clouds (232),
where the word           ‘moisture’ (ikuds) plays a part as in the Hippocratic

writer : ‘ The earth draws to itself perforce the moisture of the mind—the
same phenomenon may be observed in cress.”
   The full significance of the analogy between animal and plant life
comes out in the religious poem, where we learn that the same soul
may migrate from one to the other (frr. 117 and r27; p. 250 below).
   This evolution of life in the world of Strife, as it emerges when
stages (iti) and (iv) of Aétius are combined with                       the fragments of
Empedocles himself, has many points of resemblance to other accounts,
notably the anonymous one retailed by Diodorus in the first century
B.c.! According to this, the earth at its first formation was soft and
muddy. The sun’s warmth caused its surface to ¢ ferment’, and some of
the wet parts swelled up and produced a kind of bubbles with a thin
skin. These grew and developed, absorbing nourishment at night from
the marsh-mists and hardening by day under the heat of the sun. When
fully developed, the membranes were burst by the heat and ‘all kinds
of animals were born’.             Subsequently, as in Agtius’s report of Em-
pedacles, those containing most heat grew wings and took 1o the air,
the earthy became reptiles and other animals, and the moist ook to
the water. Later still, the earth became too hard to generate in this way
and animals were reproduced by copulation with each other. A similar
report is given by Lucretius (5.805fL.).
   These late and derivative accounts no doubt owed much to
Empedocles himself, though Anatimander had already described the
earliest animals as born in warmed moisture and enclosed in a kind of
‘bark’, which split as they came to dryer surroundings (430; vol. 1,
102). Possibly one may restore some of the missing parts of Em-
pedocles from these other accounts in the same tradition. What he said
about the transition from the ‘whole-natured forms’ to men, women
and animals has not survived. Simplicius however, following up
Aristotle’s anachronistic claim that they must in fact have consisted of
   " Diod. 1.7. The origins of the cosmogony and zoogony of Diodorus are a matter of lively
controversy. W. Spoerri has devoted a book to che subject, Spathellenistische Berichte iber Welt,
Kulewr und Goster (x959), 0 which teferences will be found. He believes that Diodorus has
worked his material into a systematic whole which shows unmistakable signs of the thought of
his own period. This however 1s not undisputed, and the chapter certainly contans passages of
purely Presocratic matter some of which must be traceable to Empedocles.       For a summary of
recent discussion see my Jn the Beginning, 132, 1. 10 and review of Spoerti i Gotz, Gel, Ang.

sperma, says that ‘whole-natured” is a very good description of sperma,
since it, like them, contains the form of man in potentiality and is every
part of the body in an undiscriminated state; ‘whereas’, he continues,
‘no part of the body is the other parts once separation has taken place
among them and the whole-natured has been torn apart’ (Phys. 382)." It
is a probable inference that the ‘whole-natured forms’ which grew out
of the earth were these “wombs’ as the Epicureans later called them, in
which, as the work of separating-out” proceeded (the action of Strife
reminds us once again of the ekkrisis of Anaximander), the various
forms of animal life could develop.?


   L.   THE    STRUCTURE           OF    ANIMATE         NATURE:         PHYSIOLOGY

                              (1) The ratio of the mixture
To explain organic tissues Empedocles makes use of the characteristic-
ally Pythagorean notion of proportionate mixture. Living things at
Jeast are compounded of the elements in certain definable mathematical
ratios. This proportion Aristotle calls the logos of the mixture, which,
whether the word was used by Empedocles or not,3 enables him to take
advantage of its ambiguity to relate the theory to his own system of
causation.
   In the first chapter of De partibus animalium Aristotle is defending
his favourite thesis that the ‘nature’ of anything, defined here as its
completed structure,* is 2 principle or cause prior to the matter.                             At
642a17 he says:
Itis the nature of a thing, rather than its matter, which is 2 principle (arche).
Empedocles too sometimes hits upon this principle, guided by the truch
itself, and is compelled to assert that the essence or nature is the logos, for
instance when he explains what bone is; for he defines it not as one of the
elements, or two or three or all of them, but as the logos of their mixture.

  ? The inference is drawn by Bignone, Emped. 580-4. The ‘wombs rooted in the earth® occur
inLucr. (5. 808)and Censorinus, De die nat. (4-9). R. Philippson in Phil. Woch. 1929, 672f., pro-
duced some evidence to suggest that they originated with Democritus. It is relevant to compare
the embryological analogy applied to trees in Aétius’s version of Empedocles.

                                        FEmpedocles
This ratio, then, is what constitutes bone. It is what Aristotle calls the
form or essence of bone, its logos in the sense of definition, as opposed
to its matter, that is, the elements which are combined in the specific
ratio,
    Repeating this information in De anima (410ar1), Aristotle quotes
the actual formula of Empedocles for bone:                                           .
Each of these [compound badies] consists of the elements not in any hap-
hazard state, bur in a certain proportion and mode of composition, as
Empedocles says of bone:
   ‘The kindly earth received in its broad melting-pots®    fwo parts of
the glitter of Nestis out of eight, and four of Hephaestu?/; and they
became white       bones,     wondrously        joined    by   the cement       ofi Harmonia®
(r. 96).2

Thus bone consists of four parts of fire, two of water, and two of earth
to make up the total of eight. The preponderance of fire may have been
suggested, as Simplicius thought, by the whiteness and dry hardness of
bone3 Aétius (5.22.1, 478) gives the formula for certain other animal
tissues as well:
Empedocles says that flesh ariginates from the four elements mixed in equal
quantities, sinews from fire and earth mixed with double the quantity of
water, the claws or nails of animals from the sinews in so far as these are
chilled by contact with the air, bones from two parts of water and earth 1o
four of fire, these parts being mixed within the earth.s

  ¥ xéavos *melting-pot’ rather than ‘funnel’ as at has most often been translated in English,
Cf. Hom. 1/ 18. 470, Hes. Th. 863, The metaphor 15 from metal-working. (See also Solmsen in
JHI, 1963, 477.) The ranslanon ‘funnels’ has probably been influenced by the belief that (as is
na doubt true) the reality hehind the metaphaor is che wdpor o tiny channels which make nuxnuce
possible (pp. 1501, above).
   * The last line is added by Simplicius, Phys. 300.24.
   3 Simplicius (De an. 68, see Emped. fr. 96) also says that the formula is in fact 4 of fire, 2 of
earth and t each of air and warcer. He supposes that Nestis is here used to cover both of the last
two. This is scatcely possible, though it would explain a troublesome little point, namely why
Empedocles should speak of a proportion of 4:2:2 rather than 2:1:3. Theophrastus also (De
sensu, 23) speaks of both bane and hair a5 comprismg ‘all the elements’.       See however Aetius
abave. (This modifies a staterent in vol. 1, p. 275, 1. 2)
   * Further light is thrown on the last few words by the summary of cosmogony in the Hippo~
cratic De carnibus, ch. 3 (viH, 536 Litird), which seems to owe something to Empedocles: * With
a long period of heat, what was formed from the putrefaction of the earth and was fatty and re~
tained the smallest quantity of moisture was most quickly burned up and became bones.” The
theory of the origin of life from a primitive ‘ putrefaction” of the earth appears in a variery of
authorities. For its currency 1n Presocratic thought cf. Plato, Phaeds, 9Gb.

                                                212
             Physiology: the Structure of Organic Tissues
   Of these examples we have the first in Empedocles’s own words
(fr. o8):
Earth chanced in about equal quantity upon these, Hephaestus, water, and
shining aither, anchored in the perfect harbours of Cypris, either a litde
more or a litcle less among more of them.’ From these arose blood and the
various forms of flesh.”
   Cornford3 was strongly of the opinion that the principle of specific
ratios was confined to organic compounds: it is the presence of definite
numerical proportion that distinguishes living creatures and their parts
from inorganic masses. He thought it probable that the tissues of plants
were included, since these also have life and soul, but nothing else.
Millerd too (Emped. 40f.) saw no evidence that the principle was
generalized, and used this as an argument against those who, like
Gomperz, have claimed for Empedocles that he anticipated the modern
chemical principle of proportional combination,                             She herself would
confine it to the actual examples mentioned (bone, blood, flesh, sinew),
and held that the phrase used by Aristotle—*/ogos of the mixture’—
has given to modern interpreters a false impression of universality.
Bignone on the other hand maintained that fir. 23* and 71 (which he
said are to be connected) at once extend the principle to the whole
animal and vegetable world, and in fact the “harmonious mixture’ of
fr. 23 implicitly affirms its universality.
   Much depends on the meaning of the word karmonia. When used as
a proper name it is the divine power also called Philia, Aphrodite and
   ¥ i whebveoss Panzerbeter for the etve nhtow iot of Simplichus.

as if blood ieself were a form of flesh, as indeed it must have been since the same formula applies
10 both. The Greek word céef, which from Homer onwards was used regularly in the plural,
covered a wider field than our *flesh’. (Cf. the eontent of the Hippocratic De carnibus.) Presum-
ably however blocd contained a larger proportion of water than did flesh. Perhaps Empedocles
intended 1o allow for this with his *about equal” and “a little more or a little less’. These phrases
at feast confess that the dacrrine of strict proportion as constituting the essensial hstincuon
berween specific organic subatances was refaxed to take account of observed differences within
what was regarded as a single kind. The same may have been dane for bone: cf. the distinction
drawn in De carn. between the compasition of salid and porous boaes (vi, §88 L.). (Bignone,
Ermped. 469 1., suggested that the language of approximation was used 1o allow for the presence
 of Love as well as the elements. Although Love was certainly present, I do not think this 3 likely
 way of alluding 10 the fact.)

Cyptis, which is the cause of a// mixture. She it is who joins zhings
together (ouvappdzet, of Aphrodite in fr.71. 4), and in this case it would
seem that neither the noun nor the verb can be confined to the special
sense of ‘combine in fixed proportion’. As a common noun, on the
other hand, at least for the Pythagoreans with whom Empedocles had
strong affinities, it connotes combination in mathematical ratio (vol. 1,
220, 223), and that is how Bignone regarded it in the simile of the
mixing of paints in fr. 23.4: ‘mixing them in Aarmonia, more of these
and less of those”.   Indeed his whole belief in the universality of the
principle depends on this. Yet what painter ever obtained his desired
shade by conforming to a recipe which laid down a numerical propor-
tion between the pigments, like a dispenser making up a‘medical
prescription? The thought is rather of the harmonious, that is pleasing,
effect produced than of the means of its production.
   Aristotle, it is said, provides evidence that Empedocles did not apply
propartion universally, for he censures him on this account as in-
consistent.   In the Metaphysics he sums up his review of the early
thinkers by saying that they were all groping after the four aspects of
causation in which he himself believed, but could not state them clearly
at a time when philosophy was still in its lisping infancy.
So Empedocles (he continues (993 a17)] says bone exists by the logos; that
is, the essence and substance of the thing. But it was equally necessary that
flesh and everything else should be the logos, or else none of them. That will
be the cause of flesh and bone and everything else—not the matter that he
alleges, fire and earth and water and air. If anyone else had said so, he would
have had to agree, but he has not put it clearly.
    This is a criticism on grounds of inadequate and obscure expression.
Empedocles, it would seem, stated the ratio of mixture of the elements
of a few organic substances like bone, and emphasized that it was this
ratio that imparted their specific character to them; but in the case of
most other substances he was content to name their elements alone,
although if the point had been put to him, he would have had to agree
that their specific character depended also on the proportions in which
these elements occurred. This is obvious, since otherwise it would have
been impossible to produce the manifold variety of nature from four
elements only.

   Elsewhere Aristotle seems to say that Empedocles’s theory demands
a rationally proportionate mixture in every compound substance (De
an. 409b32):
It is the same with any other compound at all. Each of them consists of the
elements not in any haphazard state, but in a certain Jogos and mode of
composition, as for instance Empedocles says of bone. . ..
So also Simplicius introduces fr. 96 by saying (Phys. 300.19): ‘He
makes flesh and bone and o/l the rest by a certain logos.”
   In the absence of the philosopher’s own words, any interpretarion
of this evidence must be hazardous. It seems most likely however that
Empedocles believed all natural substances, metals and minerals as well
as organic tissues, to be differentiated from one another by a different
proportion of the four common elements in their mixture.                               He gave
only a few examples of this?all from the highest and most important
stratum of existence, namely animal life, and was upbraided by Aristotle
for neglecting to extend these explanations further; but his Pythagorean
faith in the kinship of all nature makes it improbable that he regarded
inanimate objects as composed on an entirely different basis from
animate. The difference would be one of degree, and would amount to
this, that the lower anything was in the scala naturae the more unequal
would be the balance of the elements within it. This is suggested by the
fact that the highest manifestation of physical life, namely rational
thought, has for its organ the blood,3 in which the elements display the
nearest possible proportions to those in the divine Sphere, namely one
to one4 Love is the power which unites different elements with each
other. It has been shown earlier (p. 161) that the products of these
  ' Aristotle’s argument concerns those who say that perception is of like by like (as e.g.
Empedocles in fr. 109). This leads to the absurd conclusion that the percesving soul must contain
the subsrance of all dhe infinite aumber of things which it perceives. It is no use saying simply
that it cantatns the fouc elements out of which they are all composed, for how then could it be
aware of the objects as separate wholes? Their specific character depends not on the common
elements but on the logos in which in each separate case they are combined.
  The words xal 7&v &My &eaTov in Simplicius might mean only ‘each of the other organic
tissites”, but in the light of Aristotle’s reference 10 &Aho émiolv Tév auwdETey should probably be
interpreted more widely.
    * Though not without its dangers, it is perhaps permissible here to quote Bignene’s dictum
that Empedacles was after all writing a poem, not a treatise (Eniped. 363, n. 1).

unions, in a world where Love is opposed by Strife, are chance effects,
and there is nothing in the evidence here considered to alter that con-
clusion. The precise description of the proportions constituting certain
selected organic tissues might give the impression that Love was
working alone to produce those particular blends, but there is no reason
to distinguish the principle underlying their structure from that which
brought about any other compound substances. To demonstrate that
Empedocles ‘says that the parts of animals also came into being by
chance’, Simplicius (Pkys. 331.5) quotes among other exarpples the
first line of fr. 98 describing the composition of blood itself. Yet at the
same time he can say (300.25) apropos the composition ofjbone in
fr. 96: *That is, it happens by divine causation, mostly by Love or
Harmonia, for it is by her cement that they are joined.” Aristotle saw
no answer to his question: ‘Is Love the cause of any chance mixture,
or of mixture according to logos?’ The answer is that it is only from
his own teleological viewpoint that there is any essential difference
between chance and logos. The latter word, with its double significance
of ‘proportion” and ‘formal-final cause’, is his own importation.

                (2) Medicine and physiology: reproduction
The Sicilian school of medicine took its place alongside those of Cos,
Cnidus and Rhodes, and Empedocles was generally looked on as its
founder. Galen wrote:
In former days there was great rivalry between Cos and Cnidus as they
endeavoured to outdo each other in the number of their discoveries. These
were the ¢wo surviving branches of Asclepiads after the decline of Rhodes,
and they werejoined in that ‘noble wrangling’, which Hesiod eulogized, by the
physicians of Italy, Philistion, Empedocles, Pausanias and their colleagues.
There were then these three impressive groups of physicians competing with
each other. The Coan schaol was foctunate in having the most and the best
practitioners, but the Cnidian ran it close, and the Italian too was of no small
merit.


Philistion, an influential physician and writer on medicine in the fourth
century, was a native of Locri, but was also referred to as * the Sicilian’
from his connexion with the schaol. It was, says Pliny, known from
its reliance on observation as the empirical school,and began with Acron

                             Medicine and Physiology
of Acragas who owed his reputation to the fact that (like Pausanias)
he was a pupil of Empedocles.*
  In the surviving remains of Empedocles there is little information
about disease or its therapy; but we have not only his claim to impart
such information in frr. 111 and 112 (p. 132 above), but also evidence
of a consuming interest in the body and its functions. The influence of
his physiological theory is obvious in what we know of the theories of
later physicians like Philistion and Diocles, and of Plato himself. In
this respect the Timaeus owes an obvious debt to Empedocles, partly
at least through the medium of Philistion with whom in all probability
Plato was personally acquainted.?
   The arrangement of the elements in organic bodies, which is the
work of Love, is illustrated by examples of flesh-covered creatures and
those which have hard parts on the ouside. In the latter it differs, he
points out, from the order of the main masses in the world, which are
already largely the work of Strife and forecast the order that they will
assume when entirely separated.
(Fr.75) Those of them that are solid within and rare without, having got
this flaccidity in the hands of Cypris.
(Fr. 76) This you find in the heavy-backed shells of the sea-dwellers,
tritons and turtles of stony hide. There you will see earth [the heaviest ele-
ment] lying on the surface of the skin.
   Empedocles        shows     especial interest in animal reproduction.                      He
believed that the female as well as the male provides semen, different
parts of the offspring being formed from the semen of each (fr. 63,
Arist. G4, 722b10). The necessity for a correct mixture of the two
suggested to him an explanation of the sterility of mules, though we
have only Aristotle’s account of this,3 and he confesses to having found
it obscure. The reason as he gives it (G4, 747234) is that though the
semen of hoth horse and ass is soft, their mixture solidifies as the

 ‘hollows’ of each fit into the dense parts of the other. This type of
 mixture, Empedocles says, makes soft bodies hard, as happens when
 copper is alloyed with tin. (Even this explanation of the hardness of
 bronze is wrong, remarks Aristotle.) The passage affords yet another
 instance of how he applied his general principles (in this case the
 doctrine of ‘symmetry of pores’, pp. 150f. abave) to & particular case.
    Sex is determined by temperature, males being hotter than females.®
 So Aristotle (GA, 764 a1):                                                             :
 Others claim that the differentiation of sex takes place within thEe womb,?
 Thus Empedocles says that what enters a hot womb hecomes miale, what
 enters a cold womb female. The heat or coldness is determined byithe flow
of the menses, which may be either colder or hotter, older or more recent.
Again at 765 a8: ‘ We must also face the argument of Empedocles, who
differentiates male from female by the heat of the womb.” This applies
to the original formation of animals within the earth as well as to the
embryo in the womb. Of Empedocles himself we have the following
lines: (fr. 65) *And it was poured out in the purified paris;4 some
become women, when they have met with cold...” and (fr. 67.1)
“For in the warmer part of the earth appeared that which engendered
the male’.5
   Muliiple births were due to superabundance and division of the
semen.      Family resemblances ‘follow the preponderance of the seed’;

   * Arist. P,      648 2 29-31, quoted   on p. 78 above.   See Lesky,   op. <it. 31,   Die Warme-
cheorie des Empedakles.

   3 Empedocles himself may have been mare lucid than this summary of him, Presumnably the
meaning 15, as Platc says (ad foc. in Oxford trans.), that if conception takes place directly after
menstruation the offspring is male, if later fernale. But accarding to Galen (ad fr. 67) it was a
question of the right-hand s'de of the womb being warmer than the left, whereas the words of
Censorinus (5.4, DK, 481) would seem ta imply that sex depended on the semen coming frara
the right (male) or left (female) testicle. At least ‘ex dextris partibus profuso semine” does not
appear 10 refer to the receiving womb. (See also G. E. R. Lloyd in JHS, 1962, 6o, n. 19. He
thinks Censorinus’s interpretation should probably be ruled our) Empedocles’s own statement
has not sutvived.

a lack of resemblance to either parent results ‘when the heat of the
semen has evaporated”.*
   In human beings the differentiation of the parts in the embryo begins
from the thirty-sixth day and is complete from the forty-ninth, Male
embryos take shape more quickly than female, and the right-hand parts
than the left. The heart is the first organ to be formed, because it above
all contains the life of a man. The navel brings together four vessels,
two venous and two arterial, through which sanguineous and breathy
material is conveyed to nourish the embryos.                             These substances
according to Empedocles originate in the liver.?
   He believed that menstruation occurs in women when the moon is
waning, a superstitious idea with which Aristotle is rather surprisingly
inclined to agree, though more tentatively. Aristotle also gives a
reason, which since it is connected with change of temperature is likely
10 have weighed with Empedocles before him.3
   Of the drawing of the infant’s first breath Aétius reports (4.22.1,
AT4):
Empedocles says that the first breathing of the ffirst?] living creature is
[was?) caused! by the retreat of the moisture in the infants and the entering
  ¥ Agt. 5.10.¥ and 11.1 (A8x). The meaning of the clause about resemblances may be inferred
from the fuller statement of the Hippocratic De genitura 8 (Vi1 480 L.): semen is provided by the
bodies of both parents, and those parts of the offspring which contain more of the seed of one
parent will resemble the corresponding parts of that parent. But according to Empedocles tem-
perature was effective here toq, as well as in determining sex, if we may trust Censorinus.   (81,
but see Lesky, ap. cit. 36f. on these passages.)
   * All these sratements depend on secondary sources, Aétius, Censorinus and Soranus. See
483, 84,79. On the question which organ was formed first, opinion in the fifth century differed
according to the view taken of what was the central and most vital organ, Thus Alemaeon (A13)
and Anaxagoras (A 108) said 1t was the brain. For Democritus see p. 467 below.
  3 Soranus (early second century A.n.) quoted in A80, Arist. G, 738164, repeated at 767az2
and Hd, j82a34. Other physicians, says Soranus, thought menstruation more litely to occur at
full moon (Wellmann, FG4, 1.197), whereas he himself took the sensible view that the fime of
onsex difiered for different women.

and alfowed the air to return,

                                      (3) Respiration
On respiration in general we have one of Empedocles’s most picturesque
passages (fr. 100).        Modern interpretations of it differ, and the differ-
ences affect the rranslation itself. The following translation%is based on
that of N. B. Booth, and goes against the view generally accepted until
recently, though this had already been challenged by D.k]. Furley.”
Whatever interpretation is adopted, one must admit that Empedocles
does not seem to have thoughr of all the problems raised by his
theory and that his poetical language is a1 some points irretrievably
vague.
This is the way that all creatures breathe in and out. All animals have tubes
of flesh, containing little blood, stretched our deep inside the body.* At their
mouths the furthest ends of the nostrils3 are pierced through with close-set
holes, so that the blood is kept out but a free pathway for air is opened
through the passages. Then whenever the delicate blood runs away from
here, the blustering air rushes in with furious surge, but when it leaps back,
the animal breathes out. It is as when a girl plays with a water-lifter (clepsy-
drd) of shining bionze> </p>

than others (a70, pp. 208f. below).                       Most significant of all, on the
religious and moral side, our world exhibits a degeneration from an age
of peace and harmony ruled over by Aphrodite to one of discord and
slaughter (fr. 128).
The cosmogonic motion of the Sphere initiated by Strife is a revolv-
<p>ing or whirling one (Greek diné). This is a simple inference from
cosmology—the visible movements of the heavenly bodies—to cos-
mogony, followed also by Anaxagoras, who begins his cpsmogony
with a revolution initiated by Nous, and by the atomists. I;g physical
mechanism will be discussed later. Begun at a very early stige in the
break-up of the Sphere, it brings about the separation of the Sest of the
elements ‘by the impetus of the revolution’.</p>
</p>
                           Third stage: Strife triumphant
<p>From passages like fr. 17.7-8 (=26.5~6) and 21.7-8, it is evident that
there comes a time when, in complete contrast to the union of the
elements in Love, they are all completely separated by Strife.? But
the surviving information is too scanty to answer all our guestions
about this state of things. There are only two lines of Empedocles,?
which are, however, quoted by Plutarch in a descriptive context.
probable that he would follow all his predecessors, both mythical and philosophical, in the
universal assumption that our world is the result of éméepiors from a wévra ducl and not the
reverse, an assumption which contipues in Anaxagoras and the atomists. The view of Zeller
(ZN, 577) that our world is the world of increasing Love has been 5o often refuted that it can be
disregarded. See eg. Millerd, 50—z, Bignone, 561, and his appendix on the cosmic cycle in
general.
* For discussion of the evidence see p. 186 below. The explanation of the origin of the 8ivn

<p>                                 Strife Triumphant
In his dialogue On the phenomenon of @ face in the moon’s circle, he
writes (926d):
Take care that you don’t, by transposing each thing and relegating it o its
nawral place, bring about by your philosophy a dissolution of the cosmos
and saddle things with the Strife of Empedocles—or rather rouse against
nature the Titans and giants of old—and find that what you want to see, by
separating all that is heavy from all that is light, is that mythical and fearful
disorder and discord, when as Empedocles says:
          ‘Neither is the bright form of the sun distinguished
        nor yet the shaggy earth® nor the sea.”
<p>Earth had no portion of heat, nor water of air; nothing heavy was aloft,
nothing light below; the principles [elements] of all things, unmixed, un-
loving and solitary, not admitting combination or association but avoiding
and shunning one another and moving with their own stubborn motions,
wete in the state in which Plato [7T4m. 53b] says everything is from which
God is absent—that is, as bodies are when mind and soul have deserted them;
until desirability came over nature providentially when Love, Aphrodite, or
Eros was implanted in it, as Empedocles says and Parmenides and Hesiod.
The language of the sentence following the quotation leaves no
<p>doubt that Platarch’s speaker is stili paraphrasing Empedocles, It
suggests to him a comparison with the random motion of the Platonic
chaos before the divine reason of the Creator got to work on it,
and the comparison has this much point, that Empedocles o0 was
describing a state of things furthest removed from the divinity of the
Sphere. It does not follow that the motions themselves were similar,
but the parallel would hardly have occurred to Plutarch if in fact the
elements had been motionless under Strife as in the divine mixture
brought about by Love.              Their motion is confirmed by the passage
in De caelo (301214) where Aristotle says that Empedocles omitted
to describe the cosmogony of the period when Love is taking over
from Strife owing to the difficulty of describing a process of genesis
from ‘separate and moving’ elements.
This evidence may be reinforced by more general considerations.
<p>When conflict and discord prevail, it is unlikely that the result would be
peace and rest such as are the ultimate product of love and concord and

(as Empedocles would agree with the Pythagoreans) are good and desir-
able states.! There was moreover, in Presocratic systems and especially
since Parmenides, a general tendency to associate unity with rest, and
plurality withmotion.<em> There arehowever one or twoancient testimonies
which might suggest a different state of things, and unfortunately in
the absence of Empedocles’s own wordsitis difficult to be certain. There
is for instance an attractive simplicity about Zeller’s explanation that
Both processes [sc. of separation and combination] continue until complete
union on the one hand, or complete separation on the other, is a’hieved, and
this is also the duration of the movement and life of nature, and the formation
and destruction of individual things.              As soon as the goal is réached, that
movement ceases, the elements stop combining or separating—abecause they
are completely mixed or separate—and will remain in this state untl it is
disturbed by a new impulse in the opposite direction.
This interpretation goes back to Aristotle’s statement in the Physics
<p>(250b26) that according to Empedocles ‘things are alternately in
motion and at rest, in motion when Love is making the one out of
many or Strife many out of one, and at rest in the intervening periods’;
and it depends on supposing that Aristotle is referring to two periods
of rest. His precise meaning is by no means certain, and it has generally
been thought that he was misled by misunderstanding »v. 9-13 of fr. 17
which he quotes. That is, that he has erroneously assumed éwivnTor
(‘unchanged’, of the everlasting elements) to mean ‘unmoved’4    A
  </p>
</em> Pfligersdorffer even says (perhaps a tnfle 100 blundy) ‘Strife is movement, as Love is rest”
(Posidonios, 110, n. 2).
* Thus when at the beginning of the Physics Aristotle enumerates the possible number and
<p>kinds of &amp;pxal, Simplicius (22.16) comments that he omits one theoretical possibility ‘hecause
the opinion has never been held thar the épyed are many and morionless’.      Cf, Anstotle himself
at Metaph. 1004b29 ovdots Tol tvés xivnos &amp;8 ol mARGous. For Parmenides of course, whom
Empedocles respects to the limit compatible with the existence of a phenomenal world, the
association of unity and rest was a matter of logical necessity,
3 IN, 971 translated. That the natural processes of this world have ceased, and that the ele-
<p>ments can no longer continue the process of separation, 15 of cousse true, but for Zeller there was
no more to he said, Evidently in his view this implied an absalute standstill.
  # Aristotle’s meaning was already disputed among bis Greeh commentators, see Simpl. Phys.
1124, Simphcius’s own opinion was that Aristotle had taken ddvaat to mean literally unmoved,
and this has been widely asserted since Zeller’s time, e.g. by von Arnim, Feszschr. Gomperz, 18;
Millerd, Emped. 543 Bigaone, Emped. 592, n. t a0d elsewhere; Corntoed ad foc. in Laeh Physics:

understood éxfvrrar in this way (Q'Brien (for whom see p. 183 below) argues thar le did not),
those who think he did still differ among themselves as to whether he was thinking of one petiod
of rest in each complete cycle or two.</p>

the intervening period’; and his pupil Eudemus refers this period of
rest only to the Sphere under the reign of Love (ap. Simpl. 1183.28).
 Another of Aristotle’s criticisms is puzzling. Empedocles helieved,
<p>he says, that the earth is kept in its central position by the rapid revolu-
tion of the heavens, but this could not hold when the elements had been
completely separated from one another by Strife: ‘for he cannot adduce
the vortex at this stage too’ (Cael. 295a31). This has been taken as
evidence that not only vortical motion, but all motion, will have ceased
in the universe. But those who cite this and Phys. 250b26 ff. as un-
equivocal evidence for Aristotle’s opinion® should at least take into
account the mention of ‘separate and moving elements’ at Cael.
3ora1g as well
In trying to describe the state of things when Strife is supreme our
<p>sources were in all probability making conjectures in the absence of
anything on the subject in Empedocles’s own poem.? It is natural ro
suppose      that   the separated         elements      were     arranged      in concentric
circles with earth at the centre. This is perhaps implied by Aristotle’s
criticism about the vortex, and accords also with observation: at the
advanced stage of Strife which the present cosmos has reached, the
main masses of earth, water, air and fire have in fact adopted this
arrangement. Butitis nowhere explicitly stated.3 Nor canwe he certain
how long Strife remained in undisputed sway. Most probably there
  <em> So Millerd, Emped. 53 £.; Cherniss, #CP, 205. Butcf, also Bignone, Zmped. 562,n.3. O’Brien
offers an explanation based on the assumption that, since the state of complete separation is anly
womentary, the words refer to the ume when Love is beginning to increase. Then, for the ele-
menta to become mingled, heavy things would have 10 move outwards, which is the contrary of
the effect caused by a &amp;ivn as Aristotle understood it.

</em> Thus Millerd concludes (p. 54): ‘Itis not impossible that Empedocles himself left the matter
ambiguaus.. . . Save in the brief inigal summary there would be no need for an account of the
wansition from the end of the period of Strife 10 the beginning of the period of Love. Here he
may have contented himself with some such siatement as that “Strife had now won complete
sway and separated the elements, Love re~entered and he withdrew to the depths of the world."<em></em>
Zeller too (ZN, 973, n. 1) suggests that Empedocles may have given a detailed descripdon of the
Sphere bur omitted, or only mentioned tn passing, the opposite state of absolute separation.
* Bignone (pp. 223 and 562, n. 3) thinks it is shown by Arist. Cael. 205230 in conjunction with
<p>Plue. De facie 926§, where the elements are said ta be dispased in order of weight or highness.
Itis just possibly relevant to this paine that Aristotle chides Empedocles, along with Anaxagaras,
for having offered no explanation of hghtness or weight (Cael. 309319).</p>

was only an instantaneous changeover                         from the completion of the
separating process to the beginning of gradual reunion by Love. The
cycle could then be divided into three equal® periods: Strife to Love,
Sphairos, and Love to Strife.                  One would still have to describe the
elemental relation as fourfold—completely united, separating, com-
pletely separated, uniting—but the third of these would be represented
by a moment of transition only. This would explain the Jack of any
agreed explanation of what happens during the reign of Stife, and
receives support from the difficulty of imagining any stability in a state
of things where conflict and discord rage unchecked.
                 Fourth stage: the advance of Love
<p>Our main source for this part of the cosmic cycle is some lines of
Empedocles himself. Unfortunately their purport is not alogether
clear, and they have lent themselves 10 a variety of interpretations.? As
the situation will be understood here, they should be translated as
follows (fr. 35, vv. 3fL.):
When Strife reached the lowest depth of the vortex, and whenever Love
finds herself in the midst of the whirl, there all things come together to be
one only-—not suddenly, but combining from different directions at will.3
And as they came together, Strife began to retire to the boundary.? Yet
many remained unmixed alternating with those that were mingling, all those,
  <em> At Phys. 252231 Aristotle has the note: 18 8 kat &amp;t° foww Ypdvew Setrat Adyou Tivds. Like

period or a four-period cycle (whether or not the zeign of Strife in the latter were one of rest),

imply that the total of the periods of rest equalled the total of the periods of motion. [ cannot
believe ina reiga of Strife that was also a period of rest, and would conclude that Empedocles had
in mind either a three-period cycle or one in which the reign of Strife was much as Plutarch
describes it.
O’Brien argues that complete separation is instantaneous but that the Sphairos lasts as Jong as
<p>the whole period of movement, from unity to separation and back again.

<p>                               The Advance of Love
that is, that Strife still held back in suspense; for it had not all retired blame-
lessly from them to the furthest ends of the circle, but parts of it remained
within while other parts had passed out of the limbs. But as much as it
continued to run forth, so there ever pursued it a gentle immortal stream
of blameless Love. Then quickly those things grew mortal that before
knew immortality, and those that were unmixed became mixed as
they changed their ways.” And as they mingled a myriad tribes of mortal
creatures were poured forth, endowed with all sorts of shapes, a wonder
to behold.
As Love increases her power over the elements, which also means
<p>physically occupying an increasing area among them, Strife is gradually
driven out to and beyond their confines. The view most commonly
held today is that the same thing happens to Love as she is overcome by
Strife. The two change places, each banishing the other outside the
world and then invading it again from that position. On the transla-
tion given above, the effect of Strife’s re-entry is to drive Love towards
the centre and force her to contract. *As he continues his victorious
progress he penetrates the whole sphere to its lowest (i.e. innermost)
depth, and Love is penned into the very centre of the whirling mass—
whirling, becanse the effect of Strife has been to make it rotate at ever~
increasing speed (p. 186 below). The process resembles the systole and
diastole of the heart, a physiological analogy which is quite in keeping
with the tenour of Empedocles’s thought. (See Burnet, T%ales to Plato,
73.) The opening lines therefore describe the moment of Strife’s
supremacy. At this point, probably with no pause at all, Love once
more begins to expand and, starting from the centre, the elements
gradually unite with one another to form another world containing
mortal creatures. Emphasis is laid on the gradual nature of this process
and the reluctant and fighting retreat carried out by Strife. The meaning
of immortal things becoming mortal is explained by what follows. They
are the indestructible and changeless elements, which by mingling form
mortal things like plants and animals. ‘In that they have learned to
 grow one from many. . . they suffer becoming, but in that they never

 have followed them in preference to those of Miss Arundel (CR, 1962, 109-11) and Verdenius
 and Waszink (Arist, on Coming-to-de, 67).

becoming and perishing is not used stricdy (fr. 9, p. 156). In this part
of the cycle a natural world evolves by a process the reverse of that
which occurred under the ascendancy of Strife. Instead of 'whole-
natured’ animate lumps in which separate limbs and organs gradually
become distinct, we have the curious conception of isolated limbs
combining        at first haphazard            into all sorts of strange creatures
before they settled into the familiar species of a workd like our
own! It is to this part of the cycle also that Bigno le (Emped.
 5641.) would refer a brief and puzzling sentence in Aétus (1.5.2,
447) that in Empedocles there is one cosmos only, ‘but thé cosmos is
not the whole, but a small part of the whole: the rest is idle matter’,
This idle or unformed matter would then be all that ‘remained un-
mixed, alternating with the things that were mingling, all those, that is,
that Suife still held back in suspense’; in other words, such portions of
the four elements as had not yet been combined by Love to form the
compound structures of the natural world. This is perhaps the best
explanation, for it is certainly impossible to suppose that any unused
matter existed, like the apeiron of Anaximander, outside and beyond
the sphere of the four elements and Love and Strife; yet it is surprising
that the doxographer should use the word cosmos without qualification
to refer, not to the present warld, but to thae which farms the opposite
phase of the cycle. (Cf. p. 173, n. 4 above.) The passibility of either a
misunderstanding or a wrong attribution cannot be dismissed.?</p>

claiming that they were so enumerated by Empedocles himself.<em> 1f they
were, the misunderstandings of Neoplatonic and other commentators
could hardly have arisen. But the evidence of Aristotleand Theophrastus
(p- 173, n. 1 above), supported by the fragments, is decisive for the sub~
stantial correctness of the thesis that (&amp;) the cycle contains two world
periods, developed between the divine commingled Sphere of Love and
the utter separation and estrangement of the elements under Strife, and
(b)) we are now living in the phase of Strife’s increasing influence. In
assessing the interpretations of the Neoplatonic writers, it is important
to remember that they saw the early philosophersin the distorting mirror
of their own belief in two everlasting realms of existence, the sensible
and the intelligible. Simplicius as well as Philoponus attempted to find
in Empedocles an early adumbration of this Platonic ontology, in which
the divine Sphere represented the intelligible realm and the rest of the
cycle was foreshortened into a picture of the sensible. The whole is, in
their eyes, an analysis of the permanent constitution of reality and our
relation to it, metaphorically expressed, for instructional purposes, in
genetic terms.? It is all the more remarkable, and a tribute to his
scholarly conscience, that Simplicius provides so much of the material
from which we can reconstruct the unique Empedoclean scheme of two
world-processes operating in contrary directions, and refuses to gloss
over all the difficulties in his own simplified version.
The boldness of Empedocles’s conception, and the thoroughness and
<p>consistency with which be applied its principles in a detailed explana-
tion of the natural world, afford an extraordinary demonstration of the
power of the human imagination disciplined, but not inhibited or
rendered ineflective, by the intellect. He was, says Aristotle (Metaph.
985a29), the first to divide the motive principle into two contrary
forces, and the question has often been asked, what the motive for such
elaboration can have been. If he wished simply to restore reality to the
physical world and its processes, and rescue them from the Parmenidean

denial of motion and plurality, then a single cause and a single process
would have sufficed, once plurality had been restored within the ulti-
mate constitution of matter. This was how the case appeared to Anaxa-
goras: given a plurality of qualimtively different elemental ‘seeds’,
only Nous was required 1o set the mass in motion. The only convincing
answer is that for Empedocles the moral and religious order was as
important as the physical, and in equal need of explanation. For this
he turned to the primeval force of Love,” which since Hesiog and the
Orphic writers, if not eatlier, and even in the </p>
</em>Way of Seegning’ of
Parmenides himself, had been recognized as a cosmogonic aswell as a
moral power.       But Love could not explain everything.                  ‘Sinde   nature
plainly contained things contrary to the good—not only order and
beauty but disorder and ugliness—and the bad outnumbered the good
and the worthless the fine, [Empedocles] introduced Love and Strife,
each of them the cause of one of these qualities’ (Arist. Meraph.
984b32). Empedocles was haunted also by another ancient dogma
which told of increasing disharmony between man and nature and his
degeneration from a physically and morally superior type. Linked in
his mind with this tradition of a past Golden Age was the belief current
in his own Western lands that the bodily existence of men is a punish-~
ment imposed on essentially divine spirits. Why had they fallen ? What
was the source of pain and evil? If Love was active as a unifying force
both in the world at large and in the hearts of men (fr. 17.22f.), must
there not be another and even stronger power now urging both in the
direction of disintegration and evil? And what could this be but Love’s
opposite, cursed hatred, strife (£ris), Ares?<em> Given two opposing
forces, they might have remained eternally locked in an indecisive
struggle like the ‘everlasting fire’ of the Heraclitean cosmos; but this
would have left unexplained the degeneration from a Golden Age of
bounteous, beneficent nature and sinless man; and if that demand was
to be satisfied, then the Greek, with his instinct for symmetry and
reciprocity (one thinks, for example, of the ‘justice’ of Anaximander),

</em> Though he calls this force Aphrodite, Cypris and @idéns, the name Eros doss not actually
occur in the extant fragmenits. This however may well be accidental as Kranz supposed (Emped.

and his conception of time as a circular rather than a linear process,
demanded that there should be a compensating age of increasing Love.
That this era Jay beyond the bounds of our experience was no barrier
to his ever-fertile mind.?
                 Additional note: the interpretation of fr. 35
<p>The interpretation of these difficult lines given on pp. 178f. was only
reached after much heart-searching and represents a reversal of my
previous opinion undergone in the course of writing.                               Ever since I
listened to Cornford’s lectures and first read Burnet’s Early Greek
Philosophy I had taken it for granted that »v. 3 and 4 described the
Sphairos of the reign of Love. Strife was outside (fvéprarovixero péveos),
and Love ‘in the middle of the whirl’, which must be supposed to
mean ‘ occupying the whole of it”. Under her influence the elements now
join together, though notall at once (v». § and 6), so as to allow of the
formation of a world of creatures out of the partly-mixed elements
(though one would have thought that once Love was everywhere in
the sphere she would already have brought about complete union).
The other interpretation, that »». 3 and 4 describe the victory of
<p>Strife, who has penetrated from circumference to centre and penned
Love in the very middle, was given by Burnet in From Thales to Plato
(1914), p. 73, though wirhout discussion, and curiousty enough in all
three editions of £GP (1892, 1908 and 1920) he writes that as Strife
enters the sphere Love is driven outside it. The case for the supposition
that Love is driven to the centre by Strife’s predominance has tended
to go by default, since of the few scholars who have adopted it none
has done more than state it without argument. (Besides Burnet, see
e.g. Robin, Greck Thought, Eng. tr. 104.) However, Mr D. O’Brien,
' Ch. Mugler (Devenir Cycligue, 461.) points out that there can also have been a purely scientific
<p>or physical justification for the introduction of the two opposing forces. In Anaximander, differ~
entiation (&amp;méxpiois) creates a wotld which is destroyed by reabsorption. Empedocles saw that
differentiation itself, if continued unchecked, would be equally destructive to organic structures,
It was, Mugler sugggests, this discovery that gave him the idea of substituting for the unique force
of Anaximander the antagonism of two contrary forces counteracting each other. I may have
done less than justice 1o this interesting suggestion, but I am sure it is equally mistaken to leave
out the religious and moral motives which I believe to have had even more influence in bringing
Empedocles to his conception.     Mugler goes on to detect i him a first sketch of the oscillation
berween actual and poreatial energy, familiar in modern physics, as well as the law of the con-
servation of energy and the second law of thermodynamics.</p>

who has recently subjected the fragment to 2 detailed examination for a
forthcoming study of Empedocles, has concluded that it is correct.
The experience of defending the opposite view in discussion led me to
make the effort to re-read the lines with a completely open mind, as if
for the first time, and this has finally brought me to see the interpreta-
tion now given here as much the most natural. No doubt obscurities
remain, and the idea of Lave as compressible is not an easy one ta
absorb; but probability lies in that direction.                                    '
The full case must await the publication of Mr O’Brien’s                            work, but
<p>the points which have chiefly struck me on an unbiased re-reading of
the fragment are these,
(1) The difficulty of believing that #vipratov PévBos Bivng in v, 3
<p>means the same as foyora TEpporte kGKAOU in #. 10 rather than its anti-
thesis. (This had always troubled my conscience to some extent.)
(2) The translation of the verbs in v. 10 as if Strife and Love were
<p>passing each other like trains on the up and down lines. &amp;mjer in the
context of Umekmpobéor is much more likely to mean ‘pursued’. (For
UmexTrpoBéw of one pursued cf. 7/ 25.604; Od. 8.125.)
(3) The difficulty of tenses and sequence of events in yv. 3~5. When
<p>Strife Aad arrived (ixeto) at the dvéprorrov Pévlos, and Love was® in
the middle of the whirl, only then do all things come together gradually
(ouvépxeTan otk &amp;gap).           If this describes the triumph of Love, surely
the process of combination, bringing about and then destroying a world
of living creatures, should be complete.               It seems better to assume that
we are at the opposite point of the cycle, and that the complete separa-
tion of theelements was momentary, as suggested already on p. 178. Once
Strife has reached its furthest extent and confined Love to the very
centre, then there (v Tfi &amp;%, v. 5), i.e. where the unifying power of
Love was, they begin gradually to combine again. I should prefer not
to consider here any further details of Love’s position, for which the
evidence does not exist, but in placing her initially (that is,at the
beginning of her activity) at the centre of the whole mass, from which

<p>That Empedocles omitted any account of cosmogony by combination
in the period of increasing Love is stated by Aristotle (p. 173 above)
and borne out by the silence of the fragments and secondary anthorities.
Of the genesis of our own world, which as in earlier systems was a
pracess of ‘separating-out’, we have some description, though the
doxographers have unfortunately not thought fit to quote much from
Empedocles himself. This is the more tantalizing in that Clement has
preserved the four lines in which he promises to tell of it (fr. 38):
But come now, I shall tell thee the beginning, from which everything that
we now see hecame manifest: earth and billowy sea, the damp atmosphere
and aither the Titan fastening his circle tight round everything.<em>
The most informative passage is from the Stromateis, and runs as
follows (a30):

author reverts to his own terminology) was separated off from the primal
muxture'     and spread around it in a circle.               After air, fire burst out, and
having nowhere else to go ran out under the solid mass of air.* There are
two    hemispheres revolving round the earth, one endrely of fire and the
other a mixture of air {or mist, aer again] and a little fire. This he supposes
is the night. The start of the revolution is due to the accident that the fire
weighed down and overbalanced the mass.3
The essential motion initiated by Strife is that of the separation
<p>of the elements from each other and the attraction of like to like
in ever-increasing masses, In Empedocles’s own words (fr. 37): ‘Earth
augments its own body, and air augments air.’ (Cf. als}E fr. 90.)
This however immediately creates a lack of balance in the former
perfectly blended Sphere, and since the mass is still approximately
spherical in shape, the differing weights of the two first elements 10 be
separated out produced in it the rotation which still persists.4 This
rotation has been gradually acceleraring, as is to be expected when one
remembers that it began from the absolute immobility of the Sphere of
Love. Therefore, since the sun is carried round by the motion of the
whole sphere, the days have been gradually growing shorter.
When the human race was first generated from out of the earth, the day was
of the length that ten months are now, owing to the slowness of the sun’s
advance. As time went on, it became the length of seven months (Agt
§.18.1, A75).</p>

<p>The consistency with which Empedocles applies the first principles
of his cosmogony is remarkable. If at all possible he connects their
  ¢ B s    Tpdrms kpdaeas. Though meaning no mare than that air was the firse element o be
separated out of the mixture, the phraseology may afford same slight additional support to the
view, on other grounds reasonable, that Empedocles began his account of the cosmic cycle from
the Sphere of Love,

the whole sphere to start revolving.

application with some phenomenon in the present world, in this case
by a fanciful parallel with the birth of children after seven or ten
months’ gestation.
The implication that fire is heavier than ‘air’ has been thought
<p>strange, but only because of our habit of equating the four elements of
Empedocles with the four sublunary elements of Aristotle’s five-
element doctrine. In fact, although we use the Aristotelian nomen-
clature, this “air” is for Empedocles, both in name and nature, aither.
The Greeks, owing to their enviable climate, had always made a dis-
tinction between aither, the brilliant upper sky, divine itself and the
abode of divinity, and the dimmer aer at cloud-level and below.? To
the natural philosophers, until the explicit adoption of the five-element
theory, aer was simply oither contaminated with grosser matter such as
moisture. This had to be so for Empedocles, in whose system there
were only four pure elemental substances, and hence when he speaks
of aither he means this bright divine essence which in its purity occupies
(as the account here quoted says) the outermost regions with fire
beneath it. In the terrestrial regions we experience it as atmospheric
air or in even more adulterated forms, but as one of the four ‘roots’ it
might be less misleading to call it ‘ether’. The familiarity of the quartet
fire, water, earth and air makes this impracticable (hence, like Em-
pedocles, ‘I conform to custom myself”), but it is essential to be aware
that this is not the sublunary air of Aristotle. It is an element whose
main mass is more distant from the earth, and nearer the outer confines
of the round universe, than is the main mass of fire. Aérins’s version
of the separation of the elements, which also includes the further stages,
brings out the distinction well (2.6.3, A49):
Empedocles says that the aither {pure elemental air] was first separated off,
fire second, and afier that earth.        From earth, as it was excessively constricted
by the force of the revolution, water gushed out, and from water the aer
[sublunary atmosphere] was evaporated. Theheaven was formed our of aither
and the sun of fire, and from the rest was condensed the terrestrial realm.</p>

The idea of the crystalline heaven, o familiar in the middle ages and
<p>already hinted atin Parmenides (4 37) and possibly in Anaximenes,” here
becomes explicit. The Stromateis spoke of the ‘solid mass’ (wéyes) of
air, and this is further developed in Agtius. Air, it appears, was
‘frazen’ into solidity hy the action of fire.
Empedocles says that the sky is solid, made of air congealed by fire in the
manner of ice. It encloses fiery and airy substance in each hemisphere
respectively.?                                                                      !
The apparently bizarre speculations of the early thinkeés are rarely
<p>entirely divorced from observation, but sometimes depend on rather
extravagant extrapolation from it. Thus the hardening action of fire
appears in a more credible form when Empedocles speaks of the drying
out of the earth at the time when it produced the first living creatures:
So then Cypris, after she had moistened the earth with water, as she fashioned
the forms of living things gave them to swift fire to harden.3
Here the goddess plays Prometheus, and is compared to a potter baking
clay figures in the kiln. In fr. 34 the image is that of a baker mixing
flour and water, which again will be hardened into a crust by fire. The
process is similar to that in the cosmogony described by Diodorus
(r.7.2£). The earth ‘was muddy and altogether soft, then first of all
it underwent hardening# as the fite of the sun shone down upon it,
next the heat caused its surface to boil up’, and in this state it produced
the fertile bubhles in which life made its first appearance.                            Somewhat

be produced as the water, effectively homogeneons with earth in the Sphere, 15 forced out on
to its surface. For the reading and translanion of eiscat moimviousa see Bignone, 455 5., 206, n. 4.

action of heat formed not only mist but also earth (DK, 6o a1 and 4,
p- 342 below). The strange notion that heat should solidify water as
well as vaporizing it may perhaps receive some illumination from the
Aristotelian Problemata. These base a question on the observed fact
that a deposit crystallizes from the water of hot springs on the rocks
over which it flows. “Why are stones formed by hot water rather than
by cold?. .. The cause of the petrifaction is the heat, just as Empedocles
says that rocks and stones and hot waters are formed.”* The najvers of
Empedocles on this point is somewhat redeemed by the statement which
Plutarchattributes to him (seea69) that rocks have their originin * the fire
that burns in the depth of the earth’. This wins praise from Bignone (p. 72)
as a recognition of the important theory of the plutonic origin of rocks.
Nevertheless to Empedocles their origin from hot water was an equally
logical inference from observation: the essential is the presence of heat.
   To Empedocles the creation of the various contents of the physical
world appeared in general as a process of hardening, solidifying, or
‘setting’. (Cf.n. on previous page) The agent of this ‘setting” was fire,
which no doubt is the reason why Aristotle saw fire as occupying
a special position in his system, over against the other three clements:
(GG, 330b19)          Some, like Empedocles, posit four elements as primary. Yet
he too reduces them to two, for he opposes all the others to fire.
(Metaph. 985a31)       He was the first to say that the material elements are
four, yet he does not employ them as four but as two only, putting fire by
itself and treating the others—earth, air and water—as a single substance.
So one would suppose from a study of his verses.
We find a hint of this special position of fire as agent in the zoogony
of fr. 62 (p. 206 below). Otherwise it is not obvious in the extant
fragments, and Aristotle like the doxographers must have had other
passages in mind. He may also have been inclined to exaggerate its
significance, since he and Theophrastus themselves attached great
importance to the activity of fire and heat in contrast to the passivity of

   The action of heat in both soldifying and hquefymg is discussed by Aristotle, wha also
classifies substances according o whether they are solidified by heat or cold. See P4, 649229,

the other forms of matter. For Empedocles all the elements remained
“equal, coeval, each master in a different province and with its own
character’ (fr. 17.27); but the province of fire was certainly to be active
and creative. In this he had many predecessors.* He was moreover a
native of Sicily, that violent Jand where the soil is baked hard and dry
by the fierce radiance of a sun more African than European, where
by evaporation salt is extracted from the sea commercially in large
quantities,3 and the earth sends up                     fiery lava from          Etna     and    in
several places springs of hot water.

                     (2) Shape of the cosmos
Although the doxographers refer to the cosmos as a sphere, and its
halves as hemispheres, Aétius in one place says that strictly speaking
it was egg-shaped, with its height (distance from earth to sky) less
than its breadth.4 The comparison was probably suggested 10 Em-
pedocles, not by any observed facts, but by the poems of the Orphics,
in whose cosmogony a world-egg gave bicth to the generative power
of Love (Eros—Phanes) before the existence of heaven and earth, which
were subsequently formed from the two balves of the egg.                                        His
religious views are very close to those of the Orphics. The parallel may
have extended to more than the shape.                        In his introduction to the
Phaenomena of Aratus, Achilles writes:
The arrangement which we have assigned to the sphere the Orphics compare
to that in eggs. The sky is analogous to the shell, and as the afeher is sus-
pended in a circle from the heaven, so is the skin (Upfv) from the shell.S

sky, that is the elevation from ourselves, is less than the dimension in breadth. The heaven ex~
tends further in the latter direction, because the cosmos hes like an egg,” Zeller (ZN, 980, n. 2)
was inclined to take the words & mapamhnolews keioBat as refersing strictly to position only,
claiming that the rest of the descriptian appled better 0 a fartened spheroid. Nestle however
added to the note that in afl probability Empedocles had borrowed the ancient conception of the
world as an egg, a2d the introduction of the word (assuming that it is his) certainly suggests this.
Thar it shiould have precisely the shape of a bird’s egg may not have seemed necessary.
   S Kern, Orph. Fr.70,p 150; DK, vol. 1, p. 11. For the egg see especially the cosmogony of
Aristophanes's Birds, 693ff, Achilles is a writer of perhaps the third century A.D., but for the

                                 Shape of the Cosmos
This arrangement has a certain resemblance to that of Empedocles’s
cosmos, with sky corresponding to his azther which formed the outer-
most sphere, and aizher to his fire which ‘ran out under the solid mass’
at the circumnference. Empedocles was much impressed by the analogy
between the members or parts of the animal and vegetable world (fr. 82,
- 209 below), and for him and his contemporaries the world itself was
the supreme and universal animal. It is possible that the word ‘crystal-
line’ was used in connexion with eggs (vol. 1, 137), and Leucippus
compared the surface of the round universe to a skin or membrane
(U,       D.L. 9.32).        1t is an interesting if somewhar                 speculative idea
that the long-lived and influential notion of the crystalline sphere (later
spheres) may have owed its origin to the macrocosm—microcosm
analogy and the idea that the universe was essendally an enormous
egg. Whether its outer envelope should be compared to skin or shell
seems to have been something on which the natural philosophers
differed.
   Nothing is recorded of what Empedocles thought about the absolute
size of the cosmos, but he said that the sun is the same size as the earth
and twice as far above the moon as the moon is above the earth. Since
 the orbit of the sun is at the periphery of the cosmos, the vertical radius
 of the cosmos is three times the distance of the moon from the earth.!
 He followed the Pythagoreans in assigning right and left sides ta the
 cosmos, an idea which is bound up with that of the animate nature of
 the universe.?
                         (3) The sun and the rwo hemispheres
 He believed, as did Anaxagoras, that the celestial North Pole was
 originally at the zenith, and that the axis of the universe was later rilted.
 For this, according to Aétius (2.8.2, A58), he gave a mechanical
 explanation:
 credentials of the world-egg as an Orphic conception see Guthrie, Orph. and Gk. Rel. 924, The
 idea occurs in the most widely separated places. In China in Han times an astronomical theory
 was cutrent according to which heaven and earth are shaped like an egig, earth being enclosed by
 the sphere of heaven just as the yolk of an egg is enclosed by its shell (Kramer, Myrhologies of the
 Ane. World, 384, and for an identical conception in Jranian mythology, ibid. 339).

 the moon ¢(D.L. 8.77).

                                        Empedocles
He says that as the aer gave way before the onrush of the sun [i.e. the dark
hemisphere hefore that of the light; see below], the poles® were tilted, so that
the northern parts were heightened and the southern lowered, and the whole
universe affected similarly.
   Still relying on the secondary sources, we learn that the stars are
‘fiery, made from the fiery element which the air contined within
itself and squeezed out at the first separation’. They are not, therefore,
as they were for Xenophanes, the result of exhalations from earth-level,
a difference which seems to reflect the different religious obitlook of the
two men. The fised stars are imbedded ‘in the crystal’, but the planets
move freely.
   The sun is also commonly described as being of fire. Diogenes
(8.77) calls it ‘a great concentration of fire’, and Agtivs (2.6.3, A49)
says that as the elements separated the sky was farmed of aither and the
sun of fire. Only the Stromateis (a30) say that ‘the substance of the
sun is not fire, but a reflexion of fire like that from water’, Each of
these sources is perhaps over-simplifying the case. Aétius in another
passage (2.20.13, A56) credits Empedocles with a complex                                theory
about the sun which is not altogether easy to understand.3
Empedocles assumes two suns: (1) the archetype, which is fire in one hemi-
sphere of the cosmos.         It fills the hemisphere, and is always stationed op-
posite its own reflexion; (2) the visible sun.           This is a reflexion in the other
hemisphere, namely the hemisphere which is filled with air {or darkness, aer]
mixed with heat. It arises by reflexion from the earth—which is circulart—
on to the crystal-like sun, and is carried round with it by the mouon of the
fire. In brief, the sun is a reflexion of the fire surraunding, the earch.
   This may be supplemented by a further sentence of Agtius (2.21.2,
A56) that ‘the sun-by-reflexion is equal to the earth’, and a line of
    * 7&s perovs, the north and south poles. C. Anst, Meseor. 3623 32, # Eripa dpros of

                      The Sun and the Two Hemispheres
Empedocles himself which is quoted in passing in Plutarch’s De
Pych. or. (4a0b, see Empedacles fr. 44): ‘You laugh at Empedacles
for saying that the sun, originating about the earth by reflexion
of light from          the sky, “flashes back             to Olympus          with     fearless
countenance”.’
   In the absence of the ariginal it is unlikely that we can reproduce his
theory with certainty from these partial and distorted data,                              Most
probably the sun (in the ordinary accepted use of the word) is a
reflexion of the whele fiery hemisphere thrown back on to it in some
way from the earth. When the Stromareis, to emphasize that it is only
a reflexion, say that it is not itself fire, they falsify Empedocles, since
for him a reflexion consisted of effuences of particles from an object,
collected and packed together on the reflecting surface; that is, they are
of the same material as the object itself.* The term enaklasis (bending
back, re-flexion) was used not only of reflected light or images, but also
in connexion with the use of convex mirrors as burning-glasses,* and
this is obviously what was in Empedocles’s mind here. The whole
bright fiery hemisphere shines on to the earth, where its light and fire
are collected into a focus and then thrown back as a ‘great concentra-
tion3 of fire’, as Diogenes has it, to form the sun. The daily revolution
of the sphere carries the sun round with it. 1tis natural that Empedocles
should have been neither accurate nor very clear about the Jaws govern-
ing the direction of reflexions. This fits most of the testimony, including
any hints that we have in the fragments of the poem itself. Thus in
fr. 41 it is said of the sun that ‘when gathered [or massed, &hiofei)
together he circles round the great heaven’. Kranz with some plaust-
bility takes fr. 44, that the sun ‘fashes back to Olympus with fearless
countenance’, introduced by Plutarch with the remark that it originates
by reflexion of light from the sky, together with fr. 38.4 (quoted
abave, p. 185), as being the lines which                    together gave        tise to the
‘two-sun’ description           of Aétius.     ‘Titan’ suggests a reference             to the

   * Aet. 4.34.1 (a88). The point is made by Millerd, Emped, o8,

This is the fire-filled half of the crystalline hemisphere considered as
‘archetypal’ sun, whereas what ‘flashes back to Olympus’ (that is
to the sky, identical with ‘ aizher the Titan") is what we call the sun, the
dazzling and burning concentration thrown back from the earth.
   1t is incredible that this theory should not be in some way connected
with the Pythagorean ideas about the sun attributed to Philolaus.?
Philolaus was the younger man, but one cannot be certain about the
chronological relationship of the two theories. Both were] of course
known to Theophrastus, on whom Aétius, our immediate source for
both, will have been relying, and from what is said of the Philolaic
view in particular one may judge that he thought them rather absurd.
His suggestion that it might even imply a third sun is only a captious
criticism, and it is possible that the talk of ‘two suns’ is also a matter of
interpretation and that he had rather lightly thrown the two theories
together.     They      could not have been              identical, since Empedocles’s
scheme lacked the central fire of the Philolaic, and it may be a confusion
here that led Aétius to speak of the sun as reflected in the other, dark
hemisphere. This is the hemisphere of night, nor is it easy to see how
in that case, if it originated from the fiery hemisphere, it could be
reflected off the earth. Millerd tried to meet the objection that if the sun
were in this hemisphere it would be bright day, by saying that ‘fire is
not perceived unless it approaches the eye. It may be spread out in the
heavens through the whole hemisphere that encircles us without our
percetving it. 1t may travel from one hemisphere to the other in large
quantities without coming to us.’3 Even if this were correct, the idea
  * Kranz makes this point in Philologus, 1961, 290—5. Titan itself as a name for the sun does not
elsewhere occur until the Christian era, when it is frequent in poetry, but he nevertheless is a
Titan, namely Hyperion, as early as Homer (/2 15.398; Od. 1.24) as well as in later classical
wricees, Alternaavely heis the san of Ticaas (Theia and Hyperion in Hes. T4, 371-4; Hyperian,
ibid. vor1, Od. 12,1765 Hom. Hymn Dem. 26).
  * See vol. 1, 284f. To make a small additional point, both used the name Olympus for the
highest heaven. Cf. Empedocles, fr. 44 (quoted in text) and Philolaus x16. Diels (SBB, 1884,
353) thought thar the origin of the reflexion-theory of the sun was jncomprehensible without
presupposing the reflexion from Philolaus’s centra) fire.

                     The Sun: Empedocles and Philolaus
that the hemisphere of fire could be the nocturnal one, because the fire
in it escapes our eyes, is disptoved by the Stromureis (a30), which
state that not the fiery hemisphere but the hemisphere of aer ‘mixed
with a little fire’ (presumably the stars) ‘is the night’. It is also in-
compatible with frr. 48 and 49 of Empedocles himself, in the setting in
which they are presented.
Fr. 48 (Plut. Qu. Plar. 1006f): The pointers of sundials by staying still and
not changing their place with the shadows become instruments and measures
of time, like the earth which intercepts the sun when the sun passes below it,
as Empedocles says:
   ¢ The earth makes night by blocking the lights.”
Fr. 49 (Plut. Qu. conv. 720€): The aer being dark (as Empedocles says,
                  “belonging to lonely, blind-eyed” night”)
gives back through the ears what it takes away from sight of the power of
perceiving ahead.
Fr. 49 substantiates the statement of the Stromateis that the hemisphere
of aer is that of night, and fr. 48 shows that Empedocles believed the
dark effect of the nocturnal hemisphere to be ensured by the screening
off of the sun’s light by the earth. It has been claimed as an advance
on his part that by attributing night to the shadow of the earth he had
outgrown the earlier idea that darkness was a substance in itself, 2
kind of mist or exhalation.? In fact however night was still a sky-ful
of aer, and the part played by the earth’s interposition was simply to
ensure that the darkness of this substance was not counteracted by
movement of the light, That light takes t1me to0 wravel is an anticipation of modern knowiedge,
but for Empedocles it followed naturally from his view that light is a material substance ‘Howing
from the light-giving body’ (Philop. De an. 334.34, A57). 1t is stated by Aristotle, loc, cit.:
‘Empedocles, and any other who says the same, are wrong in speaking of light as travelling and
being at 2 given moment becween the earth and the surrounding sphere’; and again De sensu,
446326.
   On the other hand Millerd does draw attention to something generally overlooked: not onty
does Aétius say that the sun is a reflexion in the darker hemisphere, but Plucarch (De facie, 922.¢,
AGo) speaks canversely of people who grumble ac Empedacles for making the moon a solidifica
tion of air surraunded by the sphere of fice. Lcannot claim to understand from diis what Empe-
docles himself said, but it certainly does not explans how the sun could be a reflexion from the
dark sphere, on Millerd’s view or any other.

illumination from the light hemisphere. The only reasonable conclusion
(in which we have many predecessors, for example Tannery, Gilbert,
Heath, Burnet) is that the report of Aétius is mistaken, either because
he paraphrased          Theophrastus          unintelligently        or, more        probably,
because Theophrastus himself gave an ironically confused account of
what were to him archaic and unscientific theories.®
   A farther report about the sun is: “The sun turns because it is pre~
vented by the sphere surrounding it, and by the tropic cirgles, from
continuing for ever on a straight course’ (Aét. 2.23.3, 458).                            1As ofien,
the doxographer seems to have indiscriminately combined two state-
ments. That the sun’s course is regulated by the inner surfape of the
sphere seems aimed at the bizarre theory of Xenophanes (a472) that a
series of suns succeed one another, travelling on indefinitely in a
straight line. How Empedacles conceived of the tropic cirdles, and in
what way they could prevent the sun’s further passage North or South,
is not said. It is presumably connected with his explanation of the
seasons, which is sald to have been that ‘it is winter when the aer
through condensation predominates and is forced into the upper part,
and summer as fire predominates whenever it is forced into the lower.”
That is, in winter the darkness which fills one half of the cosmic sphere
overflows into the fiery half, and in summer the fiery half encroaches
on the dark. “The idea seems to be that the greater half of the sphere
takes longer to revolve about a particular point on the earth’s surface
than the smaller half, and that this explains why the days are longer in
the summer than in the winter’ (Heath, Ariszarchus, 88).                        But no reason
is given for the successive encroachments. They could have been a
kind of tidal effect caused by the cosmic whirl, which was in its origin
due to a certain lack of equilibrium between the dark and the bright
spheres.
   Amid so much that seems pure imagination, it is refreshing 1o recall
that Empedocles was aware of the true cause of eclipses. The sun is

eclipsed ‘when the moon passes beneath it’, says Aétius. He may have
learned this from the Pythagoreans, for Aétius attributes the same
explanation to bath; but these Jater attributions of astronomical dis-
coveries are very uncertain, and for Empedocles we have his own words.
“The moon’, says Plutarch, ‘often conceals and obliterates the sun.
As Empedocles says: “She cuts off his rays as he passes above her, and
darkens as much of the earth as is the breadth of the pale-eyed moon.” 't
Altogether, in spite of their fanciful aspects, his theories about the sun
are considerably more advanced and subtle than those of Heraclitus
and Xenophanes, with their suns lost and replaced every day and their
extraordinary ideas about eclipses. Unlike them, he gives the impression
of a man who wants to come to grips with the problems of nature for
their own sake,
                                          (4) The moon
His views about the moon                    are thus      stated in the account of the
Stromateis (A30):
He says that the moon was formed separately of the aer cut off by the fire,
which solidified like hail. It has its light from the sun.
Aétus says that it is ‘compacted air, resembling cloud, solidified by
fire, so that it is a compound’, and Plutarch describes it as ‘a solidifica~
tion of air resembling hail’. Its shape was that of a disc or lentil, that
is, round with convex sides, not spherical? The evidence that Em-
pedocles knew it to be lit from the sun is stronger than that for Par-
menides. He imitated the punning line of Parmenides that called it a
“foreign light’3 and Plutarch quates another original verse in the
following context:
There remains then the theory of Empedocles that the moonlight which we
see comes from the moon’s reflexion of the sun. That is why there is nejther
  U Adt.2.24.7(a59); Plut. De facie, 929 c (5. 42). Verse 1 of the fr.should possibly run: * She cuts

 warmth nor brilliance in ir.. .. To the contrary, just as voices when they are
 reflected produce an echo which is fainter than the original sound and the
 impact of missiles after a ricachet is weaker,
           “Thus having struck the moon’s broad disk, the ray’
 comes t0 us in a refluence weak and faint.”
 Even if the discovery must be credited to Anaxagoras (p. 306
 below), Empedocles could have known of it also. Nothing is recorded
 of his explanation of the phases or eclipses of the moon, though Heath
(Aristarchus, 91) suggested that its ‘mixed’ composition      pnight be
intended to account for the former. The description makes its forma-
tion identical with that of the outermost sphere as also given by
Aégtius (A 51), which may be why the Stromareis takes the trouble to
add the word ‘separately” (kaf” tourhyv).

                                          (5) The earth
Nothing has survived about the shape of the earth,? and it is uncertain
whether he believed it to be spherical. Neither Anaxagoras nor Demo-
critus did so, and the implication of Aétius that the axis of the cosmos
was originally perpendicular to the earth’s surface suggests that this
was flat: the two ideas are combined in Anaxagoras.3                        It remains in the
centre of the universe not because it is supported by air or anything
else, nor yet because, as Anaximander so ingeniously suppased, it has
no reason to move in one direction rather than another, but by the
action of the cosmic whirl.
Some, like Empedocles [says Aristotle], say that the motion of the sky as it
rotates in a circle at a higher speed [sc. than would be the earth’s in falling]
prevents the earth from moving. Itis like the water in cups, which when the
cup is swung round in a circle does not fall though it is often underneath the
bronze and it is natural for it to move downwards. The reason is the same.4

                         The Moon: the Earth: the Sea
This is one example out of several which indicate a genuine desire on the
partof Empedocles to hase his conclusions about the natural world on ob-
servation, evenifat that early stage of science theinference was inaccurate,
Like theillustrations of the lantern (fr. 84) and the clepsydra (fr. 100), itis
simply a matter of drawing analogies from well-known phenomena, not
of controlled experiment. The trick with the rotating cups will have been
pat of the stock-in-trade of jugglers at fairs, as Gomperz tells us it still
is (or was in his lifetime).
                                         (6)   The sea
The sea is water originally contained within the eirth, which burst out
as the earth was squeezed like a sponge by the force of the cosmic
whitl. In some way the heat of the sun was combined with this as a
causal factor, thus enabling Empedocles to invoke the microcosm—
macrocosm analogy, which for him was very real. The sea was ‘the
sweat of the earth’ (fr. §5), exuded under heat, and, like other sweat,
salt. Aristotle (Meceor. 357a24) dismissed this as a ridiculous and
meaningless metaphor, but for Empedocles it was more than that. The
sea was not entirely salt however, but contained .an imperceptible
quantity of fresh water, which produced nourishment for fish.r
   Certain features of this cosmology of Empedocles make it fairly
clear that he had studied Parmenides’s world of seeming no less than
his way of truth. The rwo hemispheres, one of fire and 1he other of
aer mixed with a little fire, suggest a derivation from the circular bands,
here is given by Gomperz, Gr, TA.1, 242. Mugler (Dev. Cy<l, 37) thinks that Aristode may have
been misled by the poetic diction of Empedocles, who intended to describe something different,
namely the behaviour of a solid body floating w a liquid contained in 2 cykndical ar spherical
vessel. Cherniss on the ather hand (4CP, 204, . 234) says that the simile must have been intended
1o explain, not why the earch does not fall, but why the outer water, air and fire do not fall upon
the earth. He refers to Heidel, Heroic Age of Seience, 188. This would form a parallel to the theory
of Anaxagoras (p. 302 below); the only doubt is whether such a gross misunderstanding of
Empedocles was possible,
    The doxographic notices are: (@) Aét. 2.6.3 (A49) ‘From earth as it was excessively con-
stricted by the force of the revolution, the water gushed out’; () idem 3.16.3 (a66) *Empedo-
cles calfs the sea the sweat of the earth, as it was scorched by the sun owing ta the increasing
compression’. Tzetzes (see 466) has a pictruresque description of the chaotic state of things when
the world was young: “ According to Empedocles the natural philosopher, the elements were still
in disorderly motion even after the appearance of earth and sea: at one time fire would get the
upper hand and burn things up, and at another the surge of water would overflow and submerge
them.” On the fresh water in 1he sea, Aehan, Nat. an. 9.64 (466), p. 247 below, and for the
same beliefin Democritus see p 424,

one made of rare matter, another of dense, “and others between these
mixed of light and darkness’. The moon, too, for Parmenides, was a
compound of both aer and fire. (See 437, pp. 61f. above.)

             XK.   THE    FORMATION             OF    LIVING        CREATURES

We have already seen how in general, ‘chemical’ terms the' various
forms of life arise. What is truly existent cannot be born or perish or
change, but strictly speaking only the four elementary substances exist:
life resules from mixtures of these substances in certain proportions.
According to the stage in the cosmic cycle at which it occuts, a thing
may both be born and perish by either the coming together or the
dissolution of the elements (fr. 17.3—5).                   Into this new framework are
fitted the current ideas (going back to Anaximander, and in mytho-
logical form further stilt) of life as originating in moistened earth under
the action of heat.          So in fr. 73 Love, the agent of mixture, mingles
earth with water, fashions the living creatures in it, and hardens them
by fire. Fr. 62 describes a similar process.
   The evolution of animal life was related to the cosmic cycle in a way
shar can be seen from a passage of Aétius supplemented by quotations
from Empedocles and other testimony. The doxographer does not
make it clear, as he was probably not clear himself, that he was describ-
ing, not a continuous evolution, but two contrary processes.                               Never-
theless the passage can be read as a concise summary of the Empedoclean
dactrine. 1t distinguishes four stages as follows.?
   * Bignone (Emped. 427) has shown it to be probable that frr. 34 and 73 should be joined as the
two halves of a simile. [*As a baker puts cakes in the oven], having cemented the meal with
water, so Cypris after she had moistened the earth with water, as she fashioned the forms of
living things gave them to swift fire 1o harden.” The custom of making cakes in the form of
animals and men would add pownt 10 the simile. Another simile describing the work of Lave
in forming compounds 15 fr. 33: ‘As when fig-juice fixes and binds white milk.' Fig-juice was
used as rennet, and the line is adapted from Homer, JZ §.90z. Here 1t may have a more par-
ticular physiolagical reference; f. Plut. Qu. naz. 9172 (478): ‘Some say that sears are ¢xcruded
like whey from milk when the blood is stirred up; so Empedocles.’
   * AgL §.19.5 (A72). The passage has been the subject of considerable discussion, but since it
seems to admis of a straightforward interpretation references to ather views would be more likely
to cloud the issue than 1o clarify it. To mention only one of the most recent, Minar in Phronesis,
1963, 14f,, supposes all four stages in Agtius 1o be contained within the period of increasing
Love.   But his assumption that to do otherwise involves canfining sexual generation entirely to
the epoch of Strife places an entirely undeserved reliance on the completeness of the doxographer’s
summary. At the same time he has to explain the absence of information about the period of
increasing Surife as due at least in part to “the fragmentary natuxe of our wradition” (p. 143).

                       The Formation of Living Creatures
Empedocles says (i) the first generations of plants’ and animals were not
entire, bur divided, with parts not grown together; (i) the second, in which
the parts grew together, were like creatures of fantasy; (iif) the third was the
generation of the whole-natured; (iv) the fourth was no longer engendered
from the elements? like earth and water but from each other, when for some
their nourishment became thick and for others the beauty of women excited
the seminal motion.?           The     kinds of all living creatures        were distributed
according to the character of their mixture: some had a more natural inclina-
tion to water, as many as had a preponderance of fire flew up into the air,¢
the heavier made for the earth, and those in whose composition the elements
were equally balanced....5

   (i) This is the earliest stage of organic life in the period when Love
is gaining and the process of evolution is from separation 16 combina~
tion. Empedocles describes it in the lines of fr. 57, which is expressly
ascribed by Aristotle to this period and by Simplicius to the first
stage of it:6
On the earth? many heads sprang up without necks, arms wandered bare,
bereft of shoulders, and eyes strayed alone in need of foreheads.

                                          Empedocles
This provides concrete illustrations of the fantastic situation ourlined
in fr. 20, taken from Simplicius (Phys. 1124.9):
Here too [sc. in the sublunary world] Empedocles says that Strife and
Love prevail in turn among men and fish and beasts and birds, when                                  he
writes:
   *This is manifest throughout the mass of mortal bodies. At one time all
the limbs which belong to the body, in the prime of blooming life, come
together into one through Love. At another, severed by evil spirits of dis-
cord, they wander, each separately, on the shores of life; and it i§ the same
for bushes, and fishes housed in water, and beasts with their mountain lairs
and birds of winged flight.”

   Aristotle’s criticism amplifies the picture slightly (G4 722bY7):
Tt is impossible for large members                to survive and be alive in separation,
which is Empedocles’s account of generation under Love. ‘Many heads’, he
says, ‘ grew up without necks', and later they were joined together.?
Simplicius, in describing with the aid of fr. 35.9—13 the state of things
when Love was gaining but Strife still active and vigorous, adds:
In this state of things the members were still * single-Jimbed’ (formed of one
limb only]® from the separation wrought by Strife, and wandered abour
longing to combine with each other.

    * This fr. is given a different application by Bignone, Emped. 410, but the interpretation of
Diuels, which he stigmatizes as erroneous, is more likely 1o be right (at least in its general reference
to the evolutionary cycle, if not in detaif). Bignone’s objection to it (571, n. x) is that it includes
plants among the organisms whose parts once sprang up separately and were joined at random,
whereas Aristotle in a baaeering moad says that Empedocles should have mentioned ‘olive-
headed vines” as well as *man-headed oxen’ (Phys. 199b 10), and Simplicius ad Joe. (382.30)
confirms that he left them out. Ir is however scareely possible, considering his elaborate striving
after consistency, that Empedacles fatled to assurme the same process for plants as for animals,      If
he confined himself to a general reference like the above, Acistotle was still entitled to have his
joke about the man who specified the animal monsters (which were already well known in Greek
mythological tradition) but did not dare ta enumerace the surprising products of his scheme in the
plant wosld. The inclusion of plants by Aétius is some confirmation that this was so, Itis difficulr
to believe, as Bignone would have us do, that the words of fr. 20 describe the individual in health
and sickness. Still more improbable is the propoesition of Kranz, advanced without argument
{ Emped. 361), that the subject of these lines is sexual intercourse.
   * Bignone (Emped. §69) sees here an affinity between Empedacies and the Orphic doctrine
cited by Acistotle, G4, 734216, that the parts of animals come into being not simultaneously but
one after the other, ‘like the weaving of a net’, There however Aristotle js referting to the forma~
tion of the foetus in the womb, not to Empedacles’s fantastic theory of the origin af Iife in another
part of the cosmic cycle.

                   Living Creatures under Advancing Love
       “But when daimon engaged more and more with daiman’,’
as Love continued to gain over Strife,
   ‘it came to pass both that these things* came together as each happened
to meet, and also many others besides them sprang up in continuous suc-
cession” (fr. 59).
This fragment must have been written in close proximity to 35.16f.
And as they [the elements] mingled, a myriad kinds of mortal creatures were
brought forth, endowed with all sorts of shapes, a wonder 1o behold.
The chance coming together of the separate limbs and organs marks the
transition to the second stage. Similarly, Simplicius says elsewhere
(PPys. 371.33) that under the rule of Love, first the parts of animals
such as heads, hands and feet appeared here and there at random, tken
they came together and gave rise to the monsters about to be described.
    (i) For the second stage of Love’s advance we have four surviving
lines of Empedocles (fr. 61):
Many were born with faces and breasts hoth front and back, oxen with the
heads of men, and conversely there sprang up creatures in human form with
the heads of oxen, and mixtures partly of men and partly of women’s nature,
fitted with shadowed3 [private] parts.
Plutarch preserves, along with the man-headed oxen, another phrase
(fr. 60): ‘shambling [cattle] with countless hands’.4
    It is at this stage that we have the theory of the survival of the
fittest which some modern commentators have likened to Darwin’s.
No words of Empedocles on the subject have survived. Aristotle refers
to it briefly in a passage where he is setting forth, in order to refute it,
   ¥ That is, as the struggle between Love and Strife continued and intensified. The comments
interpolated by Simplicius show that he ac least thought that they (not, as Zeller supposed, the
elements) are the Safpoves in question. For pioyeofo of engaging in combat cf. e.g. Hom. 77 4.456.
   ? ‘Dieses’ in the translation of DK should be ‘Diese”.
   3 Or “sterile’. Diels suggested amelpois, a probable conjecture.
   4 eikfrose. The epithet is a standing one for cattle, and cattle only, in Homer. Tn the same
meaning it occurs Jater without the noun in Theocritus 25.131. M. Timpanare Cardini (Physis,
1960, 8) thinks that by éxprréxapx Empedocles did not mean “with innumerable hands’ but “with
hands not articulated into separate fingers’, suitable appendages for mixed animal and human
creatutes. This is probable. The word is presumably modelled on the Homeric dwpiréguiios
and &xpitéguvos.    The former (JZ 2. 868) undoubredly means that the leaves were plentiful, but
 does so by calling them *indistinguishable’. (Lieselotte Solmsen in Lex. d. frikgr. Epos, s.v.:
 ‘mit meht zu unterscheidenden, dichten Blattern.”) dxpirépeovos is applied to the speech of
 ‘Thersites in 7/, 2. 246, Where confusion rather than profusion seems to be in point.

the anti-teleological view according to which any apparent signs of
purpose in nature (e.g. that front teeth should be sharp for biting, and
the molars flat to reduce the food to a digestible smoothness) are in
fact only fortuitous.
Similarly [he continues (Pfys. 198 b27)] with other organs in which we seem
to see a purpose. Where everything turned out in a way which simulated
purpose, those creatures survived because 8y chance they were constituted in
a suitable way; whereas all that were not so constituted perished, and con-
tinue to perish, as Empedocles says the ‘man-headed oxen’ d(:d.
   Commenting on this passage, Simplicius is rather more !\nformative.
After quoting fr. 62, vv. 2~3, he continues (Phys. 371.33):
Empedocles says that during the rule of Love first of all there came into
being at random parts of animals such as heads, hands and feet, and then
there came together those ‘oxen with the heads of men’, *and conversely
there sprang up’, naturally, ‘men with the heads of oxen’, that is, com-
pounded of ox and man. Asmany of these parts as were fitted together
in such a way as to ensure their preservation became animals and survived,
because they fulfilled mutual needs—the teeth tearing and softening food,
the stomach digesting it, and the liver converting it into blood. The human
head, when it meets a human body, ensures the preservation of the whole,
but being inappropriate to the ox-body it leads to its disappearance. All that
did not come together according to the proper formula [logos] perished.
   Whatever         the    superficial     resemblances         of    this   conception         to
nineteenth-century theories of evolution, it was obviously reached
   * They were probably rated most highly by Gomperz, Gr. Thinkers, 1, 244, We mnst at least
agree that they represent an attempt to explain the apparent evidence of design in nature by
purely natural, or, as the Greeks would say, ‘necessary’ causes, This reliance on blind automatism
and neglect of the final cause in Empedocles is repeatedly castigated by Aristotle. That is the
intention of his criticism at Phys. 199bg. Cf. also 196a20—5, GC, 313b15, Metaph. 1000b12,

   Fora sceptical view see Millerd, Emped. 58, She thought that Simplicius was mistakenly attri-
buting to Empedocles a view which Aristotle assigned ta athers, with only a purely incidental
mention of Empedocles. This is perhaps a possible way of reading Phys. 193b27, but T do not
think it a likely one, especially in view of his criticism of Empedocles on the same ground else-
where. Nor do I see the force of Zeller’s remark (ZN, 989, n. 3), approved by Millerd, that an
evolutionary theory based on chance could not appear until the teleolagical explanation had been
developed which it was intended to replace. Rather was the philosophic (as opposed to naive
mythological) expression of teleology developed by Socrates, Plato and Aristotle as a deliberate
attack on the automatism of earlier science. Luria, dnft d. gr. Denkens, 1963, 153, n. 208, also
takes an extreme sceptical view, but for a different assessment see M. Timpanaro Cardini in
Physis, 1960.

from very different premises and formed an integral part of a cosmo-
logical system which by nineteenth-century standards was fanciful in
the extreme. It does not refer to development in the present wotld,
but to an era in which evolution proceeded in the opposite direction.
The monsters         described are reminiscent of various figures in Greek
mythology, and it is fair to assume that Empedocles had these in mind,
for he was always glad to show that his carefully constructed system
accounted for phenomena known or believed in by his countrymen.
The Minotaur provided a bull-headed man, and other mixed forms
included centaurs and the Chimaera (lion’s head, goat’s body, and
serpent’s tail). Bisexual beings were by no means confined to Herma-
phroditos, whose cult seems to have been introduced at Athens during
the fifth century. Considering the affinities of Empedocles’s doctrines,
some have been tempted to think also of Phanes, in Orphic literature
the creator and first ruler of the gods and the world. Orphic verses
described himn as bisexual and as having the heads of a ram, a bull, a
lion and a snake.® Butalthough Phanes himself might be said to belong
to the past, in so far as a god can (he was swallowed by Zeus), it is
hardly likely that Empedacles would have wished to include this great
cosmic figure among the transient non-viable creatures which his lines
describe. More obviously in the same tradition (whatever its origin)
are the early human beings comically described by Aristophanes in
Plato’s Symposium (189dff.). These were spherical in shape and in
every way double, with four hands, legs and ears, two faces, and the
sexual parts of both male and female.?
  ' See Guthrie, Orph. and Gk. Rel. 1o1f. and 145, nn. 24 and 25, for evidence for this paragraph.
  * Some have thought that they resemble rather the olhogusis of the early stages of Swrife’s
progress. The ‘wholeness’ of their androgynous nature, and their spherical shape, can be thought
o paint in this direction, and their modification into ordinary men and wornen was the result of a
drastic act of separation. Also it can be argued that the otdopueis, assuming that they were bio-
logically sufficiently advanced in the first place, would lead happier and better lives than our-
selves, since Love was more powerful then than now; and the Aristophanic hermaphrodites
were happier than their monosexual successors,
  Qn the other hand, (3) Aristophanes’s creatures have even more limbs and sexual paris than
we do, whereas the otiogueis have none; (2) bisexual beings occur among the monsters of fr. 613
(3) in Empedocles the human beings of an age when Love was more powerful were not only
happy but morally perfect and pious worshippers, whereas Aristophanes’s creatures were so
impious that they tried to scorm heaven and attack the gods. Plato’s mind was well stocked with
traditional motifs, but it is unwise to look 100 ¢losely at the tale which an imaginative genius puts
into the mouth of one of the greatest of comic poets. 1 cannot myself believe that the ottogusis
70mar had any kind of human form.      Cf. p. 211 below.

                                         Empedocles
   From fr. 61 and the comments of Aristotle and Simplicius it follows
that there was a third stage in the period of increasing Love, not men-
tioned by Aétius: when the monstrosities had been weeded out by
natural causes, there remained men, women and animals who were the
counterpart of those in our own era.r Since Love unites heterogeneous
elements, it is presumably to this stage that Aristotle refers when he
says that ‘the hottest animals, those containing most fire, ate aquatic,
to escape the excess of heat in their own nature’.* This is the contrary
of what is said at the end of the Aétius passage (p. 201 above), that
animals seek the element most akin to the one which preponderates in
themselves. That applies to the present era of increasing\Strife, in
which each element is attracted 1o its like.
   (iif) The third stage mentioned by Agtius is an early stage in the
advance of Strife. ' Whole-natured’ (or growing as a whole, oUAoguris)
is the word used by Empedocles himself in the following description
(fr. 62):
Come now and hear this, how fire as it was separated raised up the nocturnal3
scions of men and pitiable women: it is no erring or ignorant tale. Whole-
patured forms first sprang up from the earth, having a portion of both water
and heat. These the fire sent vp, wishing to come to its like. Not yet did
they display the comely shape of limbs, nor voice nor the part proper to
men.
   Here we see the work of Strife in that fire, still mingled with the
other elements, is being separated and impelled to reach its like, the

the earch even before there was a sun, as is explicutly said of another eatly form of life, namely
trees and plants (470, p. 208 below).

fire in the earth reaching outwards towards the large mass of fire at the
circumference of the cosmos. In this process curious living forms arise
compounded of earth mixed with water and fire, without limbs, organs,
or distinction of sex. The unifying force of Love is still strong.? The
fourth element of air is not mentioned (so Bignone suggested) because
air is a component of blood and fleshy tissue {fr. 98) which these living
masses do not yet possess.? It could be absorbed later from the sur-
rounding atmosphere.            It is likely enough that Empedocles took these
pains to impose consistency on his scheme, but in the choice of the
three elements he would also be influenced by ancient traditions of the
origins of life. In Hesiod (&7ga, 59ff.) Zeus ordered the god of fire to
mix earth and water to make the first woman.                        For Anaximander life
arose from water and earth when they were heated. In Empedocles
fire retains the active role, as its heat penetrates the mixture.
    The general notion of earth as literally the mother, from within
whom not only plants but also the first animals and men originated,
is of course so old and universal as hardly to need illustration. Among
the Greeks it is reflected in myths like that of Cadmus and the ‘sown
men’    of Thebes, of Jason sowing the dragon’s teeth, of many                              auto-
chthonous heroes and gegeneis (earthborn), of Deucalion and the re-
newal of the human race after the flood from *the bones of our mother’
(i.e. stones). Tales of the marriage of earth and sky symbolize the need
of water to make earth fertile. Serious beliefs in the spontaneous genera-
tion of small animals like mice from the earth were buttressed by the
conviction that the earth had in the past possessed even greater
generative powers.3
   (iv) The fourth stage, a later one in the advance of Strife, is that in
which we now live.            Advancing discrimination and articulation have
brought into being the familiar world of self-reproducing male and
female creatures, divided into fishes, birds and land-animals.                          Love of
   * A weak point of Minar’s account in Phronesis, 1963, is the failure to see that sexual differ-
entiation, like any differentiation, is not a good but the work of Strife. Note the sexlessness of
the deny of frr. 29 and 134. That the sexes are artracted to one another may be Love's doing,
though Hippolytus says that their intercourse is the work      of Swife (see Ref. 7 29.22, 30.4,
PP- 214, 216 Wendland), buc that is a very different thing.

course is stll at work, but her power is weakening, and with the
effect of this in the human sphere we pass from the poem on nature to
the Purifications, which tells of the moral degeneration brought about
by increasing Strife. The remark in Aétius about women’s beauty may
be compared with a line of Empedocles which as printed in DK speaks
of the desire that comes upon a man through sight (fr. 64, quoted by
Plutarch in connexion with sexual love).!
   What Empedocles said about trees may fittingly find a Place here,
for besides having a considerable general interest, it shows them as a
kind of living fossil, a primitive form of life which has persi’?ted to the
present day.        Afrius paraphrases it thus (5.26.4, a70):
Empedocles says that trees were the first living things® to grow‘out of the
earth, before the sun was spread around? and day and night were distinguished.
Owing to the matching of the elements in their mixture, they corbined the
formula for male and female. They grow by being pushed up by the heat in
the earth, so that they are parts of the earth just as embryos in the belly are
paris of the womb. Fruits consist of the excess of water and fire in the plants.
Those that have insufficient moisture lose their leaves in summer as it
evaporates, but those that have more, like the laurel, clive and palm, retain
them.¢ Differences in flavour are due to the composition of the soil, and the
different ways in which the plants draw the homoeomerous substances from
that which nourishes them.5             So with vines, it is not the differences in the
vine that make a drinkable wine, but differences in the soil that sustains
them.
  * See Plut. Qu. Phys. g17c. The reference to sight is due to a conjecture by Wyttenbach.
Cataudella (Riv. d: filol. 1960, 128£.) suggests a reading closer to the MSS,, but [ find the allusion
to the aphrodssiac effects of the digestive process more in keeping with Catullan impudence (he
quotes Catullus 32.9 as a parallel) than with the present context. In any case Plucarch quotes the
line o illustrate the effects of proximuty, not satiety, which he has mentioned eaclier as a distinct
alternative.

preceded the ‘whole-natured’,
   3 mproomiedfiva, which Diels thought *omnino ineprum’ (Dox. 439), is now usually justified
by reference to Empedocles’s curious theory of the sun (pp. 192 ff. above).
   + Plutarch (Qu. conv, 649c, on fre. 77-8) says that Empedocles attributed evergreenness 1o
SpeAdTns Kpdoeeys and ouppetpla wopav. These enable the nourishment to flow smoothly and
regularly and so in sufficient quantity. Since the food is drawn from the earth in the form of
moisture, the two explanations are complementary. Plutarch’s describes the mechanism whereby
the evergreens obtain their larger supply of moisture.

                                  The Nature of Trees
    Trees, then, are the nearest in the present world to the original
‘whole-natured’ forms of life. Like them they are still rooted in the
earth, from which they are pushed up by the heat within it, and sdll
combine the characteristics of both sexes, because the persistent in-
fluence of Love combines their elements in a manner nearer to the per-
fect mixture of the Sphere than that of more recent formations.
    A further point of interest in the account is the analogy between
vegetable and animal life. The doxographer applies to trees the word
(3%«) usually confined to animals, probably because it appeared in
Empedocles. For him, with his belief in the kinship of all life, there was
no firm distinction. One may compare his own expression ‘tall olive-
trees bear eggs’ (fr. 79), the assertion in fr. 82 that hair, leaves, scales
and the wings of birds are ‘the same’, and the description of the ear as
a ‘shoot (or sprout, &305) of flesh’ (Theophr. De sensu 9, 486). Accord-
ing to the De plantis both heand Anaxagoras attributed desire, pleasure
and pain to plants, and the latter, as well as Democritus and Plato,
called them ‘earth-rooted animals’.* The paralle]l between young plants
and embryos is echoed in the Hippocratic treatise On the Nature of the
Child (277, viL. 528 Littré):
All things that grow in the eacth live off the moisture in the earth, and the
moisture in them depends on the moisture in it.* So also the child lives off
its mother in the womb, and its health depends on hers. If anyone considers
what has been said on this subject from beginning to end, he will find a
similarity between the whole nature of the products of the earth and those
of human generation.

These remarks may               owe     something        to Empedocles,          but are more
reasonably taken as arising out of the old and very general belief in
the earth as the original mother of all living things alike. The same
analogy is turned into nonsense by Aristophanes in the Clouds (232),
where the word           ‘moisture’ (ikuds) plays a part as in the Hippocratic

writer : ‘ The earth draws to itself perforce the moisture of the mind—the
same phenomenon may be observed in cress.”
   The full significance of the analogy between animal and plant life
comes out in the religious poem, where we learn that the same soul
may migrate from one to the other (frr. 117 and r27; p. 250 below).
   This evolution of life in the world of Strife, as it emerges when
stages (iti) and (iv) of Aétius are combined with                       the fragments of
Empedocles himself, has many points of resemblance to other accounts,
notably the anonymous one retailed by Diodorus in the first century
B.c.! According to this, the earth at its first formation was soft and
muddy. The sun’s warmth caused its surface to ¢ ferment’, and some of
the wet parts swelled up and produced a kind of bubbles with a thin
skin. These grew and developed, absorbing nourishment at night from
the marsh-mists and hardening by day under the heat of the sun. When
fully developed, the membranes were burst by the heat and ‘all kinds
of animals were born’.             Subsequently, as in Agtius’s report of Em-
pedacles, those containing most heat grew wings and took 1o the air,
the earthy became reptiles and other animals, and the moist ook to
the water. Later still, the earth became too hard to generate in this way
and animals were reproduced by copulation with each other. A similar
report is given by Lucretius (5.805fL.).
   These late and derivative accounts no doubt owed much to
Empedocles himself, though Anatimander had already described the
earliest animals as born in warmed moisture and enclosed in a kind of
‘bark’, which split as they came to dryer surroundings (430; vol. 1,
102). Possibly one may restore some of the missing parts of Em-
pedocles from these other accounts in the same tradition. What he said
about the transition from the ‘whole-natured forms’ to men, women
and animals has not survived. Simplicius however, following up
Aristotle’s anachronistic claim that they must in fact have consisted of
   " Diod. 1.7. The origins of the cosmogony and zoogony of Diodorus are a matter of lively
controversy. W. Spoerri has devoted a book to che subject, Spathellenistische Berichte iber Welt,
Kulewr und Goster (x959), 0 which teferences will be found. He believes that Diodorus has
worked his material into a systematic whole which shows unmistakable signs of the thought of
his own period. This however 1s not undisputed, and the chapter certainly contans passages of
purely Presocratic matter some of which must be traceable to Empedocles.       For a summary of
recent discussion see my Jn the Beginning, 132, 1. 10 and review of Spoerti i Gotz, Gel, Ang.

sperma, says that ‘whole-natured” is a very good description of sperma,
since it, like them, contains the form of man in potentiality and is every
part of the body in an undiscriminated state; ‘whereas’, he continues,
‘no part of the body is the other parts once separation has taken place
among them and the whole-natured has been torn apart’ (Phys. 382)." It
is a probable inference that the ‘whole-natured forms’ which grew out
of the earth were these “wombs’ as the Epicureans later called them, in
which, as the work of separating-out” proceeded (the action of Strife
reminds us once again of the ekkrisis of Anaximander), the various
forms of animal life could develop.?


   L.   THE    STRUCTURE           OF    ANIMATE         NATURE:         PHYSIOLOGY

                              (1) The ratio of the mixture
To explain organic tissues Empedocles makes use of the characteristic-
ally Pythagorean notion of proportionate mixture. Living things at
Jeast are compounded of the elements in certain definable mathematical
ratios. This proportion Aristotle calls the logos of the mixture, which,
whether the word was used by Empedocles or not,3 enables him to take
advantage of its ambiguity to relate the theory to his own system of
causation.
   In the first chapter of De partibus animalium Aristotle is defending
his favourite thesis that the ‘nature’ of anything, defined here as its
completed structure,* is 2 principle or cause prior to the matter.                             At
642a17 he says:
Itis the nature of a thing, rather than its matter, which is 2 principle (arche).
Empedocles too sometimes hits upon this principle, guided by the truch
itself, and is compelled to assert that the essence or nature is the logos, for
instance when he explains what bone is; for he defines it not as one of the
elements, or two or three or all of them, but as the logos of their mixture.

  ? The inference is drawn by Bignone, Emped. 580-4. The ‘wombs rooted in the earth® occur
inLucr. (5. 808)and Censorinus, De die nat. (4-9). R. Philippson in Phil. Woch. 1929, 672f., pro-
duced some evidence to suggest that they originated with Democritus. It is relevant to compare
the embryological analogy applied to trees in Aétius’s version of Empedocles.

This ratio, then, is what constitutes bone. It is what Aristotle calls the
form or essence of bone, its logos in the sense of definition, as opposed
to its matter, that is, the elements which are combined in the specific
ratio,
    Repeating this information in De anima (410ar1), Aristotle quotes
the actual formula of Empedocles for bone:                                           .
Each of these [compound badies] consists of the elements not in any hap-
hazard state, bur in a certain proportion and mode of composition, as
Empedocles says of bone:
   ‘The kindly earth received in its broad melting-pots®    fwo parts of
the glitter of Nestis out of eight, and four of Hephaestu?/; and they
became white       bones,     wondrously        joined    by   the cement       ofi Harmonia®
(r. 96).2

Thus bone consists of four parts of fire, two of water, and two of earth
to make up the total of eight. The preponderance of fire may have been
suggested, as Simplicius thought, by the whiteness and dry hardness of
bone3 Aétius (5.22.1, 478) gives the formula for certain other animal
tissues as well:
Empedocles says that flesh ariginates from the four elements mixed in equal
quantities, sinews from fire and earth mixed with double the quantity of
water, the claws or nails of animals from the sinews in so far as these are
chilled by contact with the air, bones from two parts of water and earth 1o
four of fire, these parts being mixed within the earth.s

  ¥ xéavos *melting-pot’ rather than ‘funnel’ as at has most often been translated in English,
Cf. Hom. 1/ 18. 470, Hes. Th. 863, The metaphor 15 from metal-working. (See also Solmsen in
JHI, 1963, 477.) The ranslanon ‘funnels’ has probably been influenced by the belief that (as is
na doubt true) the reality hehind the metaphaor is che wdpor o tiny channels which make nuxnuce
possible (pp. 1501, above).
   * The last line is added by Simplicius, Phys. 300.24.
   3 Simplicius (De an. 68, see Emped. fr. 96) also says that the formula is in fact 4 of fire, 2 of
earth and t each of air and warcer. He supposes that Nestis is here used to cover both of the last
two. This is scatcely possible, though it would explain a troublesome little point, namely why
Empedocles should speak of a proportion of 4:2:2 rather than 2:1:3. Theophrastus also (De
sensu, 23) speaks of both bane and hair a5 comprismg ‘all the elements’.       See however Aetius
abave. (This modifies a staterent in vol. 1, p. 275, 1. 2)
   * Further light is thrown on the last few words by the summary of cosmogony in the Hippo~
cratic De carnibus, ch. 3 (viH, 536 Litird), which seems to owe something to Empedocles: * With
a long period of heat, what was formed from the putrefaction of the earth and was fatty and re~
tained the smallest quantity of moisture was most quickly burned up and became bones.” The
theory of the origin of life from a primitive ‘ putrefaction” of the earth appears in a variery of
authorities. For its currency 1n Presocratic thought cf. Plato, Phaeds, 9Gb.

             Physiology: the Structure of Organic Tissues
   Of these examples we have the first in Empedocles’s own words
(fr. o8):
Earth chanced in about equal quantity upon these, Hephaestus, water, and
shining aither, anchored in the perfect harbours of Cypris, either a litde
more or a litcle less among more of them.’ From these arose blood and the
various forms of flesh.”
   Cornford3 was strongly of the opinion that the principle of specific
ratios was confined to organic compounds: it is the presence of definite
numerical proportion that distinguishes living creatures and their parts
from inorganic masses. He thought it probable that the tissues of plants
were included, since these also have life and soul, but nothing else.
Millerd too (Emped. 40f.) saw no evidence that the principle was
generalized, and used this as an argument against those who, like
Gomperz, have claimed for Empedocles that he anticipated the modern
chemical principle of proportional combination,                             She herself would
confine it to the actual examples mentioned (bone, blood, flesh, sinew),
and held that the phrase used by Aristotle—*/ogos of the mixture’—
has given to modern interpreters a false impression of universality.
Bignone on the other hand maintained that fir. 23* and 71 (which he
said are to be connected) at once extend the principle to the whole
animal and vegetable world, and in fact the “harmonious mixture’ of
fr. 23 implicitly affirms its universality.
   Much depends on the meaning of the word karmonia. When used as
a proper name it is the divine power also called Philia, Aphrodite and
   ¥ i whebveoss Panzerbeter for the etve nhtow iot of Simplichus.

as if blood ieself were a form of flesh, as indeed it must have been since the same formula applies
10 both. The Greek word céef, which from Homer onwards was used regularly in the plural,
covered a wider field than our *flesh’. (Cf. the eontent of the Hippocratic De carnibus.) Presum-
ably however blocd contained a larger proportion of water than did flesh. Perhaps Empedocles
intended 1o allow for this with his *about equal” and “a little more or a little less’. These phrases
at feast confess that the dacrrine of strict proportion as constituting the essensial hstincuon
berween specific organic subatances was refaxed to take account of observed differences within
what was regarded as a single kind. The same may have been dane for bone: cf. the distinction
drawn in De carn. between the compasition of salid and porous boaes (vi, §88 L.). (Bignone,
Ermped. 469 1., suggested that the language of approximation was used 1o allow for the presence
 of Love as well as the elements. Although Love was certainly present, I do not think this 3 likely
 way of alluding 10 the fact.)

Cyptis, which is the cause of a// mixture. She it is who joins zhings
together (ouvappdzet, of Aphrodite in fr.71. 4), and in this case it would
seem that neither the noun nor the verb can be confined to the special
sense of ‘combine in fixed proportion’. As a common noun, on the
other hand, at least for the Pythagoreans with whom Empedocles had
strong affinities, it connotes combination in mathematical ratio (vol. 1,
220, 223), and that is how Bignone regarded it in the simile of the
mixing of paints in fr. 23.4: ‘mixing them in Aarmonia, more of these
and less of those”.   Indeed his whole belief in the universality of the
principle depends on this. Yet what painter ever obtained his desired
shade by conforming to a recipe which laid down a numerical propor-
tion between the pigments, like a dispenser making up a‘medical
prescription? The thought is rather of the harmonious, that is pleasing,
effect produced than of the means of its production.
   Aristotle, it is said, provides evidence that Empedocles did not apply
propartion universally, for he censures him on this account as in-
consistent.   In the Metaphysics he sums up his review of the early
thinkers by saying that they were all groping after the four aspects of
causation in which he himself believed, but could not state them clearly
at a time when philosophy was still in its lisping infancy.
So Empedocles (he continues (993 a17)] says bone exists by the logos; that
is, the essence and substance of the thing. But it was equally necessary that
flesh and everything else should be the logos, or else none of them. That will
be the cause of flesh and bone and everything else—not the matter that he
alleges, fire and earth and water and air. If anyone else had said so, he would
have had to agree, but he has not put it clearly.
    This is a criticism on grounds of inadequate and obscure expression.
Empedocles, it would seem, stated the ratio of mixture of the elements
of a few organic substances like bone, and emphasized that it was this
ratio that imparted their specific character to them; but in the case of
most other substances he was content to name their elements alone,
although if the point had been put to him, he would have had to agree
that their specific character depended also on the proportions in which
these elements occurred. This is obvious, since otherwise it would have
been impossible to produce the manifold variety of nature from four
elements only.

                            Thke Logos of the Mixture
   Elsewhere Aristotle seems to say that Empedocles’s theory demands
a rationally proportionate mixture in every compound substance (De
an. 409b32):
It is the same with any other compound at all. Each of them consists of the
elements not in any haphazard state, but in a certain Jogos and mode of
composition, as for instance Empedocles says of bone. . ..
So also Simplicius introduces fr. 96 by saying (Phys. 300.19): ‘He
makes flesh and bone and o/l the rest by a certain logos.”
   In the absence of the philosopher’s own words, any interpretarion
of this evidence must be hazardous. It seems most likely however that
Empedocles believed all natural substances, metals and minerals as well
as organic tissues, to be differentiated from one another by a different
proportion of the four common elements in their mixture.                               He gave
only a few examples of this?all from the highest and most important
stratum of existence, namely animal life, and was upbraided by Aristotle
for neglecting to extend these explanations further; but his Pythagorean
faith in the kinship of all nature makes it improbable that he regarded
inanimate objects as composed on an entirely different basis from
animate. The difference would be one of degree, and would amount to
this, that the lower anything was in the scala naturae the more unequal
would be the balance of the elements within it. This is suggested by the
fact that the highest manifestation of physical life, namely rational
thought, has for its organ the blood,3 in which the elements display the
nearest possible proportions to those in the divine Sphere, namely one
to one4 Love is the power which unites different elements with each
other. It has been shown earlier (p. 161) that the products of these
  ' Aristotle’s argument concerns those who say that perception is of like by like (as e.g.
Empedocles in fr. 109). This leads to the absurd conclusion that the percesving soul must contain
the subsrance of all dhe infinite aumber of things which it perceives. It is no use saying simply
that it cantatns the fouc elements out of which they are all composed, for how then could it be
aware of the objects as separate wholes? Their specific character depends not on the common
elements but on the logos in which in each separate case they are combined.
  The words xal 7&v &My &eaTov in Simplicius might mean only ‘each of the other organic
tissites”, but in the light of Aristotle’s reference 10 &Aho émiolv Tév auwdETey should probably be
interpreted more widely.

unions, in a world where Love is opposed by Strife, are chance effects,
and there is nothing in the evidence here considered to alter that con-
clusion. The precise description of the proportions constituting certain
selected organic tissues might give the impression that Love was
working alone to produce those particular blends, but there is no reason
to distinguish the principle underlying their structure from that which
brought about any other compound substances. To demonstrate that
Empedocles ‘says that the parts of animals also came into being by
chance’, Simplicius (Pkys. 331.5) quotes among other exarpples the
first line of fr. 98 describing the composition of blood itself. Yet at the
same time he can say (300.25) apropos the composition ofjbone in
fr. 96: *That is, it happens by divine causation, mostly by Love or
Harmonia, for it is by her cement that they are joined.” Aristotle saw
no answer to his question: ‘Is Love the cause of any chance mixture,
or of mixture according to logos?’ The answer is that it is only from
his own teleological viewpoint that there is any essential difference
between chance and logos. The latter word, with its double significance
of ‘proportion” and ‘formal-final cause’, is his own importation.

                (2) Medicine and physiology: reproduction
The Sicilian school of medicine took its place alongside those of Cos,
Cnidus and Rhodes, and Empedocles was generally looked on as its
founder. Galen wrote:
In former days there was great rivalry between Cos and Cnidus as they
endeavoured to outdo each other in the number of their discoveries. These
were the ¢wo surviving branches of Asclepiads after the decline of Rhodes,
and they werejoined in that ‘noble wrangling’, which Hesiod eulogized, by the
physicians of Italy, Philistion, Empedocles, Pausanias and their colleagues.
There were then these three impressive groups of physicians competing with
each other. The Coan schaol was foctunate in having the most and the best
practitioners, but the Cnidian ran it close, and the Italian too was of no small
merit.


Philistion, an influential physician and writer on medicine in the fourth
century, was a native of Locri, but was also referred to as * the Sicilian’
from his connexion with the schaol. It was, says Pliny, known from
its reliance on observation as the empirical school,and began with Acron

                             Medicine and Physiology
of Acragas who owed his reputation to the fact that (like Pausanias)
he was a pupil of Empedocles.*
  In the surviving remains of Empedocles there is little information
about disease or its therapy; but we have not only his claim to impart
such information in frr. 111 and 112 (p. 132 above), but also evidence
of a consuming interest in the body and its functions. The influence of
his physiological theory is obvious in what we know of the theories of
later physicians like Philistion and Diocles, and of Plato himself. In
this respect the Timaeus owes an obvious debt to Empedocles, partly
at least through the medium of Philistion with whom in all probability
Plato was personally acquainted.?
   The arrangement of the elements in organic bodies, which is the
work of Love, is illustrated by examples of flesh-covered creatures and
those which have hard parts on the ouside. In the latter it differs, he
points out, from the order of the main masses in the world, which are
already largely the work of Strife and forecast the order that they will
assume when entirely separated.
(Fr.75) Those of them that are solid within and rare without, having got
this flaccidity in the hands of Cypris.
(Fr. 76) This you find in the heavy-backed shells of the sea-dwellers,
tritons and turtles of stony hide. There you will see earth [the heaviest ele-
ment] lying on the surface of the skin.
   Empedocles        shows     especial interest in animal reproduction.                      He
believed that the female as well as the male provides semen, different
parts of the offspring being formed from the semen of each (fr. 63,
Arist. G4, 722b10). The necessity for a correct mixture of the two
suggested to him an explanation of the sterility of mules, though we
have only Aristotle’s account of this,3 and he confesses to having found
it obscure. The reason as he gives it (G4, 747234) is that though the
semen of hoth horse and ass is soft, their mixture solidifies as the

 ‘hollows’ of each fit into the dense parts of the other. This type of
 mixture, Empedocles says, makes soft bodies hard, as happens when
 copper is alloyed with tin. (Even this explanation of the hardness of
 bronze is wrong, remarks Aristotle.) The passage affords yet another
 instance of how he applied his general principles (in this case the
 doctrine of ‘symmetry of pores’, pp. 150f. abave) to & particular case.
    Sex is determined by temperature, males being hotter than females.®
 So Aristotle (GA, 764 a1):                                                             :
 Others claim that the differentiation of sex takes place within thEe womb,?
 Thus Empedocles says that what enters a hot womb hecomes miale, what
 enters a cold womb female. The heat or coldness is determined byithe flow
of the menses, which may be either colder or hotter, older or more recent.
Again at 765 a8: ‘ We must also face the argument of Empedocles, who
differentiates male from female by the heat of the womb.” This applies
to the original formation of animals within the earth as well as to the
embryo in the womb. Of Empedocles himself we have the following
lines: (fr. 65) *And it was poured out in the purified paris;4 some
become women, when they have met with cold...” and (fr. 67.1)
“For in the warmer part of the earth appeared that which engendered
the male’.5
   Muliiple births were due to superabundance and division of the
semen.      Family resemblances ‘follow the preponderance of the seed’;

   * Arist. P,      648 2 29-31, quoted   on p. 78 above.   See Lesky,   op. <it. 31,   Die Warme-
cheorie des Empedakles.
   * As opposed 10 those who say that it 15 already presept in the semen.
   3 Empedocles himself may have been mare lucid than this summary of him, Presumnably the
meaning 15, as Platc says (ad foc. in Oxford trans.), that if conception takes place directly after
menstruation the offspring is male, if later fernale. But accarding to Galen (ad fr. 67) it was a
question of the right-hand s'de of the womb being warmer than the left, whereas the words of
Censorinus (5.4, DK, 481) would seem ta imply that sex depended on the semen coming frara
the right (male) or left (female) testicle. At least ‘ex dextris partibus profuso semine” does not
appear 10 refer to the receiving womb. (See also G. E. R. Lloyd in JHS, 1962, 6o, n. 19. He
thinks Censorinus’s interpretation should probably be ruled our) Empedocles’s own statement
has not sutvived.

a lack of resemblance to either parent results ‘when the heat of the
semen has evaporated”.*
   In human beings the differentiation of the parts in the embryo begins
from the thirty-sixth day and is complete from the forty-ninth, Male
embryos take shape more quickly than female, and the right-hand parts
than the left. The heart is the first organ to be formed, because it above
all contains the life of a man. The navel brings together four vessels,
two venous and two arterial, through which sanguineous and breathy
material is conveyed to nourish the embryos.                             These substances
according to Empedocles originate in the liver.?
   He believed that menstruation occurs in women when the moon is
waning, a superstitious idea with which Aristotle is rather surprisingly
inclined to agree, though more tentatively. Aristotle also gives a
reason, which since it is connected with change of temperature is likely
10 have weighed with Empedocles before him.3
   Of the drawing of the infant’s first breath Aétius reports (4.22.1,
AT4):
Empedocles says that the first breathing of the ffirst?] living creature is
[was?) caused! by the retreat of the moisture in the infants and the entering
  ¥ Agt. 5.10.¥ and 11.1 (A8x). The meaning of the clause about resemblances may be inferred
from the fuller statement of the Hippocratic De genitura 8 (Vi1 480 L.): semen is provided by the
bodies of both parents, and those parts of the offspring which contain more of the seed of one
parent will resemble the corresponding parts of that parent. But according to Empedocles tem-
perature was effective here toq, as well as in determining sex, if we may trust Censorinus.   (81,
but see Lesky, ap. cit. 36f. on these passages.)
   * All these sratements depend on secondary sources, Aétius, Censorinus and Soranus. See
483, 84,79. On the question which organ was formed first, opinion in the fifth century differed
according to the view taken of what was the central and most vital organ, Thus Alemaeon (A13)
and Anaxagoras (A 108) said 1t was the brain. For Democritus see p. 467 below.
  3 Soranus (early second century A.n.) quoted in A80, Arist. G, 738164, repeated at 767az2
and Hd, j82a34. Other physicians, says Soranus, thought menstruation more litely to occur at
full moon (Wellmann, FG4, 1.197), whereas he himself took the sensible view that the fime of
onsex difiered for different women.

cool the tugutos Bepucoic (Wellmann, FG.A4, 71), and refrigeration was also its primary function
in Aristotle,

mediately afterwards exhalation was caused by the innate warmth in its surge
towards the sucface driving out the air, and inhalation as it retreated inwards
and alfowed the air to return,

                                      (3) Respiration
On respiration in general we have one of Empedocles’s most picturesque
passages (fr. 100).        Modern interpretations of it differ, and the differ-
ences affect the rranslation itself. The following translation%is based on
that of N. B. Booth, and goes against the view generally accepted until
recently, though this had already been challenged by D.k]. Furley.”
Whatever interpretation is adopted, one must admit that Empedocles
does not seem to have thoughr of all the problems raised by his
theory and that his poetical language is a1 some points irretrievably
vague.
This is the way that all creatures breathe in and out. All animals have tubes
of flesh, containing little blood, stretched our deep inside the body.* At their
mouths the furthest ends of the nostrils3 are pierced through with close-set
holes, so that the blood is kept out but a free pathway for air is opened
through the passages. Then whenever the delicate blood runs away from
here, the blustering air rushes in with furious surge, but when it leaps back,
the animal breathes out. It is as when a girl plays with a water-lifter (clepsy-
drd) of shining bionze> </em> The najvers of
Empedocles on this point is somewhat redeemed by the statement which
Plutarchattributes to him (seea69) that rocks have their originin <em> the fire
that burns in the depth of the earth’. This wins praise from Bignone (p. 72)
as a recognition of the important theory of the plutonic origin of rocks.
Nevertheless to Empedocles their origin from hot water was an equally
logical inference from observation: the essential is the presence of heat.
To Empedocles the creation of the various contents of the physical
<p>world appeared in general as a process of hardening, solidifying, or
‘setting’. (Cf.n. on previous page) The agent of this ‘setting” was fire,
which no doubt is the reason why Aristotle saw fire as occupying
a special position in his system, over against the other three clements:
(GG, 330b19)          Some, like Empedocles, posit four elements as primary. Yet
he too reduces them to two, for he opposes all the others to fire.
(Metaph. 985a31)       He was the first to say that the material elements are
four, yet he does not employ them as four but as two only, putting fire by
itself and treating the others—earth, air and water—as a single substance.
So one would suppose from a study of his verses.
We find a hint of this special position of fire as agent in the zoogony
of fr. 62 (p. 206 below). Otherwise it is not obvious in the extant
fragments, and Aristotle like the doxographers must have had other
passages in mind. He may also have been inclined to exaggerate its
significance, since he and Theophrastus themselves attached great
importance to the activity of fire and heat in contrast to the passivity of

the other forms of matter. For Empedocles all the elements remained
“equal, coeval, each master in a different province and with its own
character’ (fr. 17.27); but the province of fire was certainly to be active
and creative. In this he had many predecessors.* He was moreover a
native of Sicily, that violent Jand where the soil is baked hard and dry
by the fierce radiance of a sun more African than European, where
by evaporation salt is extracted from the sea commercially in large
quantities,3 and the earth sends up                     fiery lava from          Etna     and    in
several places springs of hot water.</p>
                  (2) Shape of the cosmos
<p>Although the doxographers refer to the cosmos as a sphere, and its
halves as hemispheres, Aétius in one place says that strictly speaking
it was egg-shaped, with its height (distance from earth to sky) less
than its breadth.4 The comparison was probably suggested 10 Em-
pedocles, not by any observed facts, but by the poems of the Orphics,
in whose cosmogony a world-egg gave bicth to the generative power
of Love (Eros—Phanes) before the existence of heaven and earth, which
were subsequently formed from the two balves of the egg.                                        His
religious views are very close to those of the Orphics. The parallel may
have extended to more than the shape.                        In his introduction to the
Phaenomena of Aratus, Achilles writes:
The arrangement which we have assigned to the sphere the Orphics compare
to that in eggs. The sky is analogous to the shell, and as the afeher is sus-
pended in a circle from the heaven, so is the skin (Upfv) from the shell.S</p>

tends further in the latter direction, because the cosmos hes like an egg,” Zeller (ZN, 980, n. 2)

claiming that the rest of the descriptian appled better 0 a fartened spheroid. Nestle however

<p>                                 Shape of the Cosmos
This arrangement has a certain resemblance to that of Empedocles’s
cosmos, with sky corresponding to his azther which formed the outer-
most sphere, and aizher to his fire which ‘ran out under the solid mass’
at the circumnference. Empedocles was much impressed by the analogy
between the members or parts of the animal and vegetable world (fr. 82,
<ul>
<li>209 below), and for him and his contemporaries the world itself was
the supreme and universal animal. It is possible that the word ‘crystal-
line’ was used in connexion with eggs (vol. 1, 137), and Leucippus
compared the surface of the round universe to a skin or membrane
(U,       D.L. 9.32).        1t is an interesting if somewhar                 speculative idea
that the long-lived and influential notion of the crystalline sphere (later
spheres) may have owed its origin to the macrocosm—microcosm
analogy and the idea that the universe was essendally an enormous
egg. Whether its outer envelope should be compared to skin or shell
seems to have been something on which the natural philosophers
differed.
 Nothing is recorded of what Empedocles thought about the absolute
size of the cosmos, but he said that the sun is the same size as the earth
and twice as far above the moon as the moon is above the earth. Since
 the orbit of the sun is at the periphery of the cosmos, the vertical radius
 of the cosmos is three times the distance of the moon from the earth.!
 He followed the Pythagoreans in assigning right and left sides ta the
 cosmos, an idea which is bound up with that of the animate nature of
 the universe.?
                    (3) The sun and the rwo hemispheres
<p> He believed, as did Anaxagoras, that the celestial North Pole was
 originally at the zenith, and that the axis of the universe was later rilted.
 For this, according to Aétius (2.8.2, A58), he gave a mechanical
 explanation:
 credentials of the world-egg as an Orphic conception see Guthrie, Orph. and Gk. Rel. 924, The
 idea occurs in the most widely separated places. In China in Han times an astronomical theory
 was cutrent according to which heaven and earth are shaped like an egig, earth being enclosed by
 the sphere of heaven just as the yolk of an egg is enclosed by its shell (Kramer, Myrhologies of the
 Ane. World, 384, and for an identical conception in Jranian mythology, ibid. 339).
  ¥ Aét. 2.21,2,31.1 (A56and 61). Consistently with this, he said that the sun was larger than
 the moon ¢(D.L. 8.77).

He says that as the aer gave way before the onrush of the sun [i.e. the dark
hemisphere hefore that of the light; see below], the poles® were tilted, so that
the northern parts were heightened and the southern lowered, and the whole
universe affected similarly.
Still relying on the secondary sources, we learn that the stars are
<p>‘fiery, made from the fiery element which the air contined within
itself and squeezed out at the first separation’. They are not, therefore,
as they were for Xenophanes, the result of exhalations from earth-level,
a difference which seems to reflect the different religious obitlook of the
two men. The fised stars are imbedded ‘in the crystal’, but the planets
move freely.
The sun is also commonly described as being of fire. Diogenes
<p>(8.77) calls it ‘a great concentration of fire’, and Agtivs (2.6.3, A49)
says that as the elements separated the sky was farmed of aither and the
sun of fire. Only the Stromateis (a30) say that ‘the substance of the
sun is not fire, but a reflexion of fire like that from water’, Each of
these sources is perhaps over-simplifying the case. Aétius in another
passage (2.20.13, A56) credits Empedocles with a complex                                theory
about the sun which is not altogether easy to understand.3
Empedocles assumes two suns: (1) the archetype, which is fire in one hemi-
sphere of the cosmos.         It fills the hemisphere, and is always stationed op-
posite its own reflexion; (2) the visible sun.           This is a reflexion in the other
hemisphere, namely the hemisphere which is filled with air {or darkness, aer]
mixed with heat. It arises by reflexion from the earth—which is circulart—
on to the crystal-like sun, and is carried round with it by the mouon of the
fire. In brief, the sun is a reflexion of the fire surraunding, the earch.
This may be supplemented by a further sentence of Agtius (2.21.2,
<p>A56) that ‘the sun-by-reflexion is equal to the earth’, and a line of
 * 7&amp;s perovs, the north and south poles. C. Anst, Meseor. 3623 32, # Eripa dpros of

<p>have been copying a theory of Anaximenes, but there are obscurities and difficulties about the
arsibution, and it is by no means clear that Anaximenes distinguished between fixed stars and
planets, though some have thought he did. See vol. s, 135

shared by Msllerd, DK, and others. Seealso Kranz in RA. Mus. 1959, 1231,

<p>                      The Sun and the Two Hemispheres
Empedocles himself which is quoted in passing in Plutarch’s De
Pych. or. (4a0b, see Empedacles fr. 44): ‘You laugh at Empedacles
for saying that the sun, originating about the earth by reflexion
of light from          the sky, “flashes back             to Olympus          with     fearless
countenance”.’
In the absence of the ariginal it is unlikely that we can reproduce his
<p>theory with certainty from these partial and distorted data,                              Most
probably the sun (in the ordinary accepted use of the word) is a
reflexion of the whele fiery hemisphere thrown back on to it in some
way from the earth. When the Stromareis, to emphasize that it is only
a reflexion, say that it is not itself fire, they falsify Empedocles, since
for him a reflexion consisted of effuences of particles from an object,
collected and packed together on the reflecting surface; that is, they are
of the same material as the object itself.<em> The term enaklasis (bending
back, re-flexion) was used not only of reflected light or images, but also
in connexion with the use of convex mirrors as burning-glasses,</em> and
this is obviously what was in Empedocles’s mind here. The whole
bright fiery hemisphere shines on to the earth, where its light and fire
are collected into a focus and then thrown back as a ‘great concentra-
tion3 of fire’, as Diogenes has it, to form the sun. The daily revolution
of the sphere carries the sun round with it. 1tis natural that Empedocles
should have been neither accurate nor very clear about the Jaws govern-
ing the direction of reflexions. This fits most of the testimony, including
any hints that we have in the fragments of the poem itself. Thus in
fr. 41 it is said of the sun that ‘when gathered [or massed, &amp;hiofei)
together he circles round the great heaven’. Kranz with some plaust-
bility takes fr. 44, that the sun ‘fashes back to Olympus with fearless
countenance’, introduced by Plutarch with the remark that it originates
by reflexion of light from the sky, together with fr. 38.4 (quoted
abave, p. 185), as being the lines which                    together gave        tise to the
‘two-sun’ description           of Aétius.     ‘Titan’ suggests a reference             to the</p>

This is the fire-filled half of the crystalline hemisphere considered as
‘archetypal’ sun, whereas what ‘flashes back to Olympus’ (that is
to the sky, identical with ‘ aizher the Titan") is what we call the sun, the
dazzling and burning concentration thrown back from the earth.
1t is incredible that this theory should not be in some way connected
<p>with the Pythagorean ideas about the sun attributed to Philolaus.?
Philolaus was the younger man, but one cannot be certain about the
chronological relationship of the two theories. Both were] of course
known to Theophrastus, on whom Aétius, our immediate source for
both, will have been relying, and from what is said of the Philolaic
view in particular one may judge that he thought them rather absurd.
His suggestion that it might even imply a third sun is only a captious
criticism, and it is possible that the talk of ‘two suns’ is also a matter of
interpretation and that he had rather lightly thrown the two theories
together.     They      could not have been              identical, since Empedocles’s
scheme lacked the central fire of the Philolaic, and it may be a confusion
here that led Aétius to speak of the sun as reflected in the other, dark
hemisphere. This is the hemisphere of night, nor is it easy to see how
in that case, if it originated from the fiery hemisphere, it could be
reflected off the earth. Millerd tried to meet the objection that if the sun
were in this hemisphere it would be bright day, by saying that ‘fire is
not perceived unless it approaches the eye. It may be spread out in the
heavens through the whole hemisphere that encircles us without our
percetving it. 1t may travel from one hemisphere to the other in large
quantities without coming to us.’3 Even if this were correct, the idea
  <em> Kranz makes this point in Philologus, 1961, 290—5. Titan itself as a name for the sun does not
elsewhere occur until the Christian era, when it is frequent in poetry, but he nevertheless is a
Titan, namely Hyperion, as early as Homer (/2 15.398; Od. 1.24) as well as in later classical
wricees, Alternaavely heis the san of Ticaas (Theia and Hyperion in Hes. T4, 371-4; Hyperian,
ibid. vor1, Od. 12,1765 Hom. Hymn Dem. 26).
  </em> See vol. 1, 284f. To make a small additional point, both used the name Olympus for the
highest heaven. Cf. Empedocles, fr. 44 (quoted in text) and Philolaus x16. Diels (SBB, 1884,
353) thought thar the origin of the reflexion-theory of the sun was jncomprehensible without
presupposing the reflexion from Philolaus’s centra) fire.

<p>                     The Sun: Empedocles and Philolaus
that the hemisphere of fire could be the nocturnal one, because the fire
in it escapes our eyes, is disptoved by the Stromureis (a30), which
state that not the fiery hemisphere but the hemisphere of aer ‘mixed
with a little fire’ (presumably the stars) ‘is the night’. It is also in-
compatible with frr. 48 and 49 of Empedocles himself, in the setting in
which they are presented.
Fr. 48 (Plut. Qu. Plar. 1006f): The pointers of sundials by staying still and
not changing their place with the shadows become instruments and measures
of time, like the earth which intercepts the sun when the sun passes below it,
as Empedocles says:
¢ The earth makes night by blocking the lights.”
<p>Fr. 49 (Plut. Qu. conv. 720€): The aer being dark (as Empedocles says,
               “belonging to lonely, blind-eyed” night”)
<p>gives back through the ears what it takes away from sight of the power of
perceiving ahead.
Fr. 49 substantiates the statement of the Stromateis that the hemisphere
of aer is that of night, and fr. 48 shows that Empedocles believed the
dark effect of the nocturnal hemisphere to be ensured by the screening
off of the sun’s light by the earth. It has been claimed as an advance
on his part that by attributing night to the shadow of the earth he had
outgrown the earlier idea that darkness was a substance in itself, 2
kind of mist or exhalation.? In fact however night was still a sky-ful
of aer, and the part played by the earth’s interposition was simply to
ensure that the darkness of this substance was not counteracted by
movement of the light, That light takes t1me to0 wravel is an anticipation of modern knowiedge,
but for Empedocles it followed naturally from his view that light is a material substance ‘Howing
from the light-giving body’ (Philop. De an. 334.34, A57). 1t is stated by Aristotle, loc, cit.:
‘Empedocles, and any other who says the same, are wrong in speaking of light as travelling and
being at 2 given moment becween the earth and the surrounding sphere’; and again De sensu,
446326.
On the other hand Millerd does draw attention to something generally overlooked: not onty
<p>does Aétius say that the sun is a reflexion in the darker hemisphere, but Plucarch (De facie, 922.¢,
AGo) speaks canversely of people who grumble ac Empedacles for making the moon a solidifica
tion of air surraunded by the sphere of fice. Lcannot claim to understand from diis what Empe-
docles himself said, but it certainly does not explans how the sun could be a reflexion from the
dark sphere, on Millerd’s view or any other.

illumination from the light hemisphere. The only reasonable conclusion
(in which we have many predecessors, for example Tannery, Gilbert,
Heath, Burnet) is that the report of Aétius is mistaken, either because
he paraphrased          Theophrastus          unintelligently        or, more        probably,
because Theophrastus himself gave an ironically confused account of
what were to him archaic and unscientific theories.®
A farther report about the sun is: “The sun turns because it is pre~
<p>vented by the sphere surrounding it, and by the tropic cirgles, from
continuing for ever on a straight course’ (Aét. 2.23.3, 458).                            1As ofien,
the doxographer seems to have indiscriminately combined two state-
ments. That the sun’s course is regulated by the inner surfape of the
sphere seems aimed at the bizarre theory of Xenophanes (a472) that a
series of suns succeed one another, travelling on indefinitely in a
straight line. How Empedacles conceived of the tropic cirdles, and in
what way they could prevent the sun’s further passage North or South,
is not said. It is presumably connected with his explanation of the
seasons, which is sald to have been that ‘it is winter when the aer
through condensation predominates and is forced into the upper part,
and summer as fire predominates whenever it is forced into the lower.”
That is, in winter the darkness which fills one half of the cosmic sphere
overflows into the fiery half, and in summer the fiery half encroaches
on the dark. “The idea seems to be that the greater half of the sphere
takes longer to revolve about a particular point on the earth’s surface
than the smaller half, and that this explains why the days are longer in
the summer than in the winter’ (Heath, Ariszarchus, 88).                        But no reason
is given for the successive encroachments. They could have been a
kind of tidal effect caused by the cosmic whirl, which was in its origin
due to a certain lack of equilibrium between the dark and the bright
spheres.

<p>                                   The Seasons.          Eclipses
eclipsed ‘when the moon passes beneath it’, says Aétius. He may have
learned this from the Pythagoreans, for Aétius attributes the same
explanation to bath; but these Jater attributions of astronomical dis-
coveries are very uncertain, and for Empedocles we have his own words.
“The moon’, says Plutarch, ‘often conceals and obliterates the sun.
As Empedocles says: “She cuts off his rays as he passes above her, and
darkens as much of the earth as is the breadth of the pale-eyed moon.” 't
Altogether, in spite of their fanciful aspects, his theories about the sun
are considerably more advanced and subtle than those of Heraclitus
and Xenophanes, with their suns lost and replaced every day and their
extraordinary ideas about eclipses. Unlike them, he gives the impression
of a man who wants to come to grips with the problems of nature for
their own sake,
                                       (4) The moon
<p>His views about the moon                    are thus      stated in the account of the
Stromateis (A30):
He says that the moon was formed separately of the aer cut off by the fire,
which solidified like hail. It has its light from the sun.
Aétus says that it is ‘compacted air, resembling cloud, solidified by
fire, so that it is a compound’, and Plutarch describes it as ‘a solidifica~
tion of air resembling hail’. Its shape was that of a disc or lentil, that
is, round with convex sides, not spherical? The evidence that Em-
pedocles knew it to be lit from the sun is stronger than that for Par-
menides. He imitated the punning line of Parmenides that called it a
“foreign light’3 and Plutarch quates another original verse in the
following context:
There remains then the theory of Empedocles that the moonlight which we
see comes from the moon’s reflexion of the sun. That is why there is nejther
  U Adt.2.24.7(a59); Plut. De facie, 929 c (5. 42). Verse 1 of the fr.should possibly run: </p>

        “Thus having struck the moon’s broad disk, the ray’

 Even if the discovery must be credited to Anaxagoras (p. 306
 below), Empedocles could have known of it also. Nothing is recorded
 of his explanation of the phases or eclipses of the moon, though Heath
(Aristarchus, 91) suggested that its ‘mixed’ composition      pnight be
intended to account for the former. The description makes its forma-
tion identical with that of the outermost sphere as also given by
Aégtius (A 51), which may be why the Stromareis takes the trouble to
add the word ‘separately” (kaf” tourhyv).</p>
</p>
                                       (5) The earth
<p>Nothing has survived about the shape of the earth,? and it is uncertain
whether he believed it to be spherical. Neither Anaxagoras nor Demo-
critus did so, and the implication of Aétius that the axis of the cosmos
was originally perpendicular to the earth’s surface suggests that this
was flat: the two ideas are combined in Anaxagoras.3                        It remains in the
centre of the universe not because it is supported by air or anything
else, nor yet because, as Anaximander so ingeniously suppased, it has
no reason to move in one direction rather than another, but by the
action of the cosmic whirl.
Some, like Empedocles [says Aristotle], say that the motion of the sky as it
rotates in a circle at a higher speed [sc. than would be the earth’s in falling]
prevents the earth from moving. Itis like the water in cups, which when the
cup is swung round in a circle does not fall though it is often underneath the
bronze and it is natural for it to move downwards. The reason is the same.4

<p>                         The Moon: the Earth: the Sea
This is one example out of several which indicate a genuine desire on the
partof Empedocles to hase his conclusions about the natural world on ob-
servation, evenifat that early stage of science theinference was inaccurate,
Like theillustrations of the lantern (fr. 84) and the clepsydra (fr. 100), itis
simply a matter of drawing analogies from well-known phenomena, not
of controlled experiment. The trick with the rotating cups will have been
pat of the stock-in-trade of jugglers at fairs, as Gomperz tells us it still
is (or was in his lifetime).
                                      (6)   The sea
<p>The sea is water originally contained within the eirth, which burst out
as the earth was squeezed like a sponge by the force of the cosmic
whitl. In some way the heat of the sun was combined with this as a
causal factor, thus enabling Empedocles to invoke the microcosm—
macrocosm analogy, which for him was very real. The sea was ‘the
sweat of the earth’ (fr. §5), exuded under heat, and, like other sweat,
salt. Aristotle (Meceor. 357a24) dismissed this as a ridiculous and
meaningless metaphor, but for Empedocles it was more than that. The
sea was not entirely salt however, but contained .an imperceptible
quantity of fresh water, which produced nourishment for fish.r
Certain features of this cosmology of Empedocles make it fairly
<p>clear that he had studied Parmenides’s world of seeming no less than
his way of truth. The rwo hemispheres, one of fire and 1he other of
aer mixed with a little fire, suggest a derivation from the circular bands,
here is given by Gomperz, Gr, TA.1, 242. Mugler (Dev. Cy<l, 37) thinks that Aristode may have
been misled by the poetic diction of Empedocles, who intended to describe something different,
namely the behaviour of a solid body floating w a liquid contained in 2 cykndical ar spherical
vessel. Cherniss on the ather hand (4CP, 204, . 234) says that the simile must have been intended
1o explain, not why the earch does not fall, but why the outer water, air and fire do not fall upon
the earth. He refers to Heidel, Heroic Age of Seience, 188. This would form a parallel to the theory
of Anaxagoras (p. 302 below); the only doubt is whether such a gross misunderstanding of
Empedocles was possible,
    The doxographic notices are: (@) Aét. 2.6.3 (A49) ‘From earth as it was excessively con-
stricted by the force of the revolution, the water gushed out’; () idem 3.16.3 (a66) *Empedo-
cles calfs the sea the sweat of the earth, as it was scorched by the sun owing ta the increasing
compression’. Tzetzes (see 466) has a pictruresque description of the chaotic state of things when
the world was young: “ According to Empedocles the natural philosopher, the elements were still
in disorderly motion even after the appearance of earth and sea: at one time fire would get the
upper hand and burn things up, and at another the surge of water would overflow and submerge
them.” On the fresh water in 1he sea, Aehan, Nat. an. 9.64 (466), p. 247 below, and for the
same beliefin Democritus see p 424,

one made of rare matter, another of dense, “and others between these
mixed of light and darkness’. The moon, too, for Parmenides, was a
compound of both aer and fire. (See 437, pp. 61f. above.)

             XK.   THE    FORMATION             OF    LIVING        CREATURES

We have already seen how in general, ‘chemical’ terms the' various
forms of life arise. What is truly existent cannot be born or perish or
change, but strictly speaking only the four elementary substances exist:
life resules from mixtures of these substances in certain proportions.
According to the stage in the cosmic cycle at which it occuts, a thing
may both be born and perish by either the coming together or the
dissolution of the elements (fr. 17.3—5).                   Into this new framework are
fitted the current ideas (going back to Anaximander, and in mytho-
logical form further stilt) of life as originating in moistened earth under
the action of heat.          So in fr. 73 Love, the agent of mixture, mingles
earth with water, fashions the living creatures in it, and hardens them
by fire. Fr. 62 describes a similar process.
   The evolution of animal life was related to the cosmic cycle in a way
shar can be seen from a passage of Aétius supplemented by quotations
from Empedocles and other testimony. The doxographer does not
make it clear, as he was probably not clear himself, that he was describ-
ing, not a continuous evolution, but two contrary processes.                               Never-
theless the passage can be read as a concise summary of the Empedoclean
dactrine. 1t distinguishes four stages as follows.?
   * Bignone (Emped. 427) has shown it to be probable that frr. 34 and 73 should be joined as the
two halves of a simile. [*As a baker puts cakes in the oven], having cemented the meal with
water, so Cypris after she had moistened the earth with water, as she fashioned the forms of
living things gave them to swift fire 1o harden.” The custom of making cakes in the form of
animals and men would add pownt 10 the simile. Another simile describing the work of Lave
in forming compounds 15 fr. 33: ‘As when fig-juice fixes and binds white milk.' Fig-juice was
used as rennet, and the line is adapted from Homer, JZ §.90z. Here 1t may have a more par-
ticular physiolagical reference; f. Plut. Qu. naz. 9172 (478): ‘Some say that sears are ¢xcruded
like whey from milk when the blood is stirred up; so Empedocles.’
   * AgL §.19.5 (A72). The passage has been the subject of considerable discussion, but since it
seems to admis of a straightforward interpretation references to ather views would be more likely
to cloud the issue than 1o clarify it. To mention only one of the most recent, Minar in Phronesis,
1963, 14f,, supposes all four stages in Agtius 1o be contained within the period of increasing
Love.   But his assumption that to do otherwise involves canfining sexual generation entirely to
the epoch of Strife places an entirely undeserved reliance on the completeness of the doxographer’s
summary. At the same time he has to explain the absence of information about the period of
increasing Surife as due at least in part to “the fragmentary natuxe of our wradition” (p. 143).

                       The Formation of Living Creatures
Empedocles says (i) the first generations of plants’ and animals were not
entire, bur divided, with parts not grown together; (i) the second, in which
the parts grew together, were like creatures of fantasy; (iif) the third was the
generation of the whole-natured; (iv) the fourth was no longer engendered
from the elements? like earth and water but from each other, when for some
their nourishment became thick and for others the beauty of women excited
the seminal motion.?           The     kinds of all living creatures        were distributed
according to the character of their mixture: some had a more natural inclina-
tion to water, as many as had a preponderance of fire flew up into the air,¢
the heavier made for the earth, and those in whose composition the elements
were equally balanced....5

   (i) This is the earliest stage of organic life in the period when Love
is gaining and the process of evolution is from separation 16 combina~
tion. Empedocles describes it in the lines of fr. 57, which is expressly
ascribed by Aristotle to this period and by Simplicius to the first
stage of it:6
On the earth? many heads sprang up without necks, arms wandered bare,
bereft of shoulders, and eyes strayed alone in need of foreheads.

organic world, When the mingling is complete, in the perfect Sphere, everything is duotov in both
senses. (It is oot bourd, fr. 29.3.)

                                          Empedocles
This provides concrete illustrations of the fantastic situation ourlined
in fr. 20, taken from Simplicius (Phys. 1124.9):
Here too [sc. in the sublunary world] Empedocles says that Strife and
Love prevail in turn among men and fish and beasts and birds, when                                  he
writes:
   *This is manifest throughout the mass of mortal bodies. At one time all
the limbs which belong to the body, in the prime of blooming life, come
together into one through Love. At another, severed by evil spirits of dis-
cord, they wander, each separately, on the shores of life; and it i§ the same
for bushes, and fishes housed in water, and beasts with their mountain lairs
and birds of winged flight.”

   Aristotle’s criticism amplifies the picture slightly (G4 722bY7):
Tt is impossible for large members                to survive and be alive in separation,
which is Empedocles’s account of generation under Love. ‘Many heads’, he
says, ‘ grew up without necks', and later they were joined together.?
Simplicius, in describing with the aid of fr. 35.9—13 the state of things
when Love was gaining but Strife still active and vigorous, adds:
In this state of things the members were still * single-Jimbed’ (formed of one
limb only]® from the separation wrought by Strife, and wandered abour
longing to combine with each other.

    * This fr. is given a different application by Bignone, Emped. 410, but the interpretation of
Diuels, which he stigmatizes as erroneous, is more likely 1o be right (at least in its general reference
to the evolutionary cycle, if not in detaif). Bignone’s objection to it (571, n. x) is that it includes
plants among the organisms whose parts once sprang up separately and were joined at random,
whereas Aristotle in a baaeering moad says that Empedocles should have mentioned ‘olive-
headed vines” as well as *man-headed oxen’ (Phys. 199b 10), and Simplicius ad Joe. (382.30)
confirms that he left them out. Ir is however scareely possible, considering his elaborate striving
after consistency, that Empedacles fatled to assurme the same process for plants as for animals,      If
he confined himself to a general reference like the above, Acistotle was still entitled to have his
joke about the man who specified the animal monsters (which were already well known in Greek
mythological tradition) but did not dare ta enumerace the surprising products of his scheme in the
plant wosld. The inclusion of plants by Aétius is some confirmation that this was so, Itis difficulr
to believe, as Bignone would have us do, that the words of fr. 20 describe the individual in health
and sickness. Still more improbable is the propoesition of Kranz, advanced without argument
{ Emped. 361), that the subject of these lines is sexual intercourse.
   * Bignone (Emped. §69) sees here an affinity between Empedacies and the Orphic doctrine
cited by Acistotle, G4, 734216, that the parts of animals come into being not simultaneously but
one after the other, ‘like the weaving of a net’, There however Aristotle js referting to the forma~
tion of the foetus in the womb, not to Empedacles’s fantastic theory of the origin af Iife in another
part of the cosmic cycle.
   ? See fr. 8 The compound adjective wowouhii is clearly Empedecles’s.

                   Living Creatures under Advancing Love
       “But when daimon engaged more and more with daiman’,’
as Love continued to gain over Strife,
   ‘it came to pass both that these things* came together as each happened
to meet, and also many others besides them sprang up in continuous suc-
cession” (fr. 59).
This fragment must have been written in close proximity to 35.16f.
And as they [the elements] mingled, a myriad kinds of mortal creatures were
brought forth, endowed with all sorts of shapes, a wonder 1o behold.
The chance coming together of the separate limbs and organs marks the
transition to the second stage. Similarly, Simplicius says elsewhere
(PPys. 371.33) that under the rule of Love, first the parts of animals
such as heads, hands and feet appeared here and there at random, tken
they came together and gave rise to the monsters about to be described.
    (i) For the second stage of Love’s advance we have four surviving
lines of Empedocles (fr. 61):
Many were born with faces and breasts hoth front and back, oxen with the
heads of men, and conversely there sprang up creatures in human form with
the heads of oxen, and mixtures partly of men and partly of women’s nature,
fitted with shadowed3 [private] parts.
Plutarch preserves, along with the man-headed oxen, another phrase
(fr. 60): ‘shambling [cattle] with countless hands’.4
    It is at this stage that we have the theory of the survival of the
fittest which some modern commentators have likened to Darwin’s.
No words of Empedocles on the subject have survived. Aristotle refers
to it briefly in a passage where he is setting forth, in order to refute it,
   ¥ That is, as the struggle between Love and Strife continued and intensified. The comments
interpolated by Simplicius show that he ac least thought that they (not, as Zeller supposed, the
elements) are the Safpoves in question. For pioyeofo of engaging in combat cf. e.g. Hom. 77 4.456.
   ? ‘Dieses’ in the translation of DK should be ‘Diese”.
   3 Or “sterile’. Diels suggested amelpois, a probable conjecture.
   4 eikfrose. The epithet is a standing one for cattle, and cattle only, in Homer. Tn the same
meaning it occurs Jater without the noun in Theocritus 25.131. M. Timpanare Cardini (Physis,
1960, 8) thinks that by éxprréxapx Empedocles did not mean “with innumerable hands’ but “with
hands not articulated into separate fingers’, suitable appendages for mixed animal and human
creatutes. This is probable. The word is presumably modelled on the Homeric dwpiréguiios
and &xpitéguvos.    The former (JZ 2. 868) undoubredly means that the leaves were plentiful, but
 does so by calling them *indistinguishable’. (Lieselotte Solmsen in Lex. d. frikgr. Epos, s.v.:
 ‘mit meht zu unterscheidenden, dichten Blattern.”) dxpirépeovos is applied to the speech of
 ‘Thersites in 7/, 2. 246, Where confusion rather than profusion seems to be in point.

                                         Empedocles
the anti-teleological view according to which any apparent signs of
purpose in nature (e.g. that front teeth should be sharp for biting, and
the molars flat to reduce the food to a digestible smoothness) are in
fact only fortuitous.
Similarly [he continues (Pfys. 198 b27)] with other organs in which we seem
to see a purpose. Where everything turned out in a way which simulated
purpose, those creatures survived because 8y chance they were constituted in
a suitable way; whereas all that were not so constituted perished, and con-
tinue to perish, as Empedocles says the ‘man-headed oxen’ d(:d.
   Commenting on this passage, Simplicius is rather more !\nformative.
After quoting fr. 62, vv. 2~3, he continues (Phys. 371.33):
Empedocles says that during the rule of Love first of all there came into
being at random parts of animals such as heads, hands and feet, and then
there came together those ‘oxen with the heads of men’, *and conversely
there sprang up’, naturally, ‘men with the heads of oxen’, that is, com-
pounded of ox and man. Asmany of these parts as were fitted together
in such a way as to ensure their preservation became animals and survived,
because they fulfilled mutual needs—the teeth tearing and softening food,
the stomach digesting it, and the liver converting it into blood. The human
head, when it meets a human body, ensures the preservation of the whole,
but being inappropriate to the ox-body it leads to its disappearance. All that
did not come together according to the proper formula [logos] perished.
   Whatever         the    superficial     resemblances         of    this   conception         to
nineteenth-century theories of evolution, it was obviously reached
   * They were probably rated most highly by Gomperz, Gr. Thinkers, 1, 244, We mnst at least
agree that they represent an attempt to explain the apparent evidence of design in nature by
purely natural, or, as the Greeks would say, ‘necessary’ causes, This reliance on blind automatism
and neglect of the final cause in Empedocles is repeatedly castigated by Aristotle. That is the
intention of his criticism at Phys. 199bg. Cf. also 196a20—5, GC, 313b15, Metaph. 1000b12,
De caelo, 300b25-30, PA, 610219, De resp. 473215.
   Fora sceptical view see Millerd, Emped. 58, She thought that Simplicius was mistakenly attri-
buting to Empedocles a view which Aristotle assigned ta athers, with only a purely incidental
mention of Empedocles. This is perhaps a possible way of reading Phys. 193b27, but T do not
think it a likely one, especially in view of his criticism of Empedocles on the same ground else-
where. Nor do I see the force of Zeller’s remark (ZN, 989, n. 3), approved by Millerd, that an
evolutionary theory based on chance could not appear until the teleolagical explanation had been
developed which it was intended to replace. Rather was the philosophic (as opposed to naive
mythological) expression of teleology developed by Socrates, Plato and Aristotle as a deliberate
attack on the automatism of earlier science. Luria, dnft d. gr. Denkens, 1963, 153, n. 208, also

from very different premises and formed an integral part of a cosmo-
logical system which by nineteenth-century standards was fanciful in
the extreme. It does not refer to development in the present wotld,
but to an era in which evolution proceeded in the opposite direction.
The monsters         described are reminiscent of various figures in Greek
mythology, and it is fair to assume that Empedocles had these in mind,
for he was always glad to show that his carefully constructed system
accounted for phenomena known or believed in by his countrymen.
The Minotaur provided a bull-headed man, and other mixed forms
included centaurs and the Chimaera (lion’s head, goat’s body, and
serpent’s tail). Bisexual beings were by no means confined to Herma-
phroditos, whose cult seems to have been introduced at Athens during
the fifth century. Considering the affinities of Empedocles’s doctrines,
some have been tempted to think also of Phanes, in Orphic literature
the creator and first ruler of the gods and the world. Orphic verses
described himn as bisexual and as having the heads of a ram, a bull, a
lion and a snake.® Butalthough Phanes himself might be said to belong
to the past, in so far as a god can (he was swallowed by Zeus), it is
hardly likely that Empedacles would have wished to include this great
cosmic figure among the transient non-viable creatures which his lines
describe. More obviously in the same tradition (whatever its origin)
are the early human beings comically described by Aristophanes in
Plato’s Symposium (189dff.). These were spherical in shape and in
every way double, with four hands, legs and ears, two faces, and the
sexual parts of both male and female.?
  ' See Guthrie, Orph. and Gk. Rel. 1o1f. and 145, nn. 24 and 25, for evidence for this paragraph.
  * Some have thought that they resemble rather the olhogusis of the early stages of Swrife’s
progress. The ‘wholeness’ of their androgynous nature, and their spherical shape, can be thought
o paint in this direction, and their modification into ordinary men and wornen was the result of a
drastic act of separation. Also it can be argued that the otdopueis, assuming that they were bio-
logically sufficiently advanced in the first place, would lead happier and better lives than our-
selves, since Love was more powerful then than now; and the Aristophanic hermaphrodites
were happier than their monosexual successors,
  Qn the other hand, (3) Aristophanes’s creatures have even more limbs and sexual paris than
we do, whereas the otiogueis have none; (2) bisexual beings occur among the monsters of fr. 613
(3) in Empedocles the human beings of an age when Love was more powerful were not only
happy but morally perfect and pious worshippers, whereas Aristophanes’s creatures were so
impious that they tried to scorm heaven and attack the gods. Plato’s mind was well stocked with
traditional motifs, but it is unwise to look 100 ¢losely at the tale which an imaginative genius puts
into the mouth of one of the greatest of comic poets. 1 cannot myself believe that the ottogusis
70mar had any kind of human form.      Cf. p. 211 below.

                                         Empedocles
   From fr. 61 and the comments of Aristotle and Simplicius it follows
that there was a third stage in the period of increasing Love, not men-
tioned by Aétius: when the monstrosities had been weeded out by
natural causes, there remained men, women and animals who were the
counterpart of those in our own era.r Since Love unites heterogeneous
elements, it is presumably to this stage that Aristotle refers when he
says that ‘the hottest animals, those containing most fire, ate aquatic,
to escape the excess of heat in their own nature’.* This is the contrary
of what is said at the end of the Aétius passage (p. 201 above), that
animals seek the element most akin to the one which preponderates in
themselves. That applies to the present era of increasing\Strife, in
which each element is attracted 1o its like.
   (iif) The third stage mentioned by Agtius is an early stage in the
advance of Strife. ' Whole-natured’ (or growing as a whole, oUAoguris)
is the word used by Empedocles himself in the following description
(fr. 62):
Come now and hear this, how fire as it was separated raised up the nocturnal3
scions of men and pitiable women: it is no erring or ignorant tale. Whole-
patured forms first sprang up from the earth, having a portion of both water
and heat. These the fire sent vp, wishing to come to its like. Not yet did
they display the comely shape of limbs, nor voice nor the part proper to
men.
   Here we see the work of Strife in that fire, still mingled with the
other elements, is being separated and impelled to reach its like, the

is provided by Theophrastus in the next chapter of De causis plant. (1.22.2-3, 11, 43 Wimmer):

trees and plants (470, p. 208 below).

fire in the earth reaching outwards towards the large mass of fire at the
circumference of the cosmos. In this process curious living forms arise
compounded of earth mixed with water and fire, without limbs, organs,
or distinction of sex. The unifying force of Love is still strong.? The
fourth element of air is not mentioned (so Bignone suggested) because
air is a component of blood and fleshy tissue {fr. 98) which these living
masses do not yet possess.? It could be absorbed later from the sur-
rounding atmosphere.            It is likely enough that Empedocles took these
pains to impose consistency on his scheme, but in the choice of the
three elements he would also be influenced by ancient traditions of the
origins of life. In Hesiod (&7ga, 59ff.) Zeus ordered the god of fire to
mix earth and water to make the first woman.                        For Anaximander life
arose from water and earth when they were heated. In Empedocles
fire retains the active role, as its heat penetrates the mixture.
    The general notion of earth as literally the mother, from within
whom not only plants but also the first animals and men originated,
is of course so old and universal as hardly to need illustration. Among
the Greeks it is reflected in myths like that of Cadmus and the ‘sown
men’    of Thebes, of Jason sowing the dragon’s teeth, of many                              auto-
chthonous heroes and gegeneis (earthborn), of Deucalion and the re-
newal of the human race after the flood from *the bones of our mother’
(i.e. stones). Tales of the marriage of earth and sky symbolize the need
of water to make earth fertile. Serious beliefs in the spontaneous genera-
tion of small animals like mice from the earth were buttressed by the
conviction that the earth had in the past possessed even greater
generative powers.3
   (iv) The fourth stage, a later one in the advance of Strife, is that in
which we now live.            Advancing discrimination and articulation have
brought into being the familiar world of self-reproducing male and
female creatures, divided into fishes, birds and land-animals.                          Love of

entiation, like any differentiation, is not a good but the work of Strife. Note the sexlessness of
the deny of frr. 29 and 134. That the sexes are artracted to one another may be Love's doing,
though Hippolytus says that their intercourse is the work      of Swife (see Ref. 7 29.22, 30.4,
PP- 214, 216 Wendland), buc that is a very different thing.

course is stll at work, but her power is weakening, and with the
effect of this in the human sphere we pass from the poem on nature to
the Purifications, which tells of the moral degeneration brought about
by increasing Strife. The remark in Aétius about women’s beauty may
be compared with a line of Empedocles which as printed in DK speaks
of the desire that comes upon a man through sight (fr. 64, quoted by
Plutarch in connexion with sexual love).!
   What Empedocles said about trees may fittingly find a Place here,
for besides having a considerable general interest, it shows them as a
kind of living fossil, a primitive form of life which has persi’?ted to the
present day.        Afrius paraphrases it thus (5.26.4, a70):
Empedocles says that trees were the first living things® to grow‘out of the
earth, before the sun was spread around? and day and night were distinguished.
Owing to the matching of the elements in their mixture, they corbined the
formula for male and female. They grow by being pushed up by the heat in
the earth, so that they are parts of the earth just as embryos in the belly are
paris of the womb. Fruits consist of the excess of water and fire in the plants.
Those that have insufficient moisture lose their leaves in summer as it
evaporates, but those that have more, like the laurel, clive and palm, retain
them.¢ Differences in flavour are due to the composition of the soil, and the
different ways in which the plants draw the homoeomerous substances from
that which nourishes them.5             So with vines, it is not the differences in the
vine that make a drinkable wine, but differences in the soil that sustains
them.
  * See Plut. Qu. Phys. g17c. The reference to sight is due to a conjecture by Wyttenbach.
Cataudella (Riv. d: filol. 1960, 128£.) suggests a reading closer to the MSS,, but [ find the allusion
to the aphrodssiac effects of the digestive process more in keeping with Catullan impudence (he
quotes Catullus 32.9 as a parallel) than with the present context. In any case Plucarch quotes the

alternative.

SpeAdTns Kpdoeeys and ouppetpla wopav. These enable the nourishment to flow smoothly and
regularly and so in sufficient quantity. Since the food is drawn from the earth in the form of
moisture, the two explanations are complementary. Plutarch’s describes the mechanism whereby
the evergreens obtain their larger supply of moisture.

                                  The Nature of Trees
    Trees, then, are the nearest in the present world to the original
‘whole-natured’ forms of life. Like them they are still rooted in the
earth, from which they are pushed up by the heat within it, and sdll
combine the characteristics of both sexes, because the persistent in-
fluence of Love combines their elements in a manner nearer to the per-
fect mixture of the Sphere than that of more recent formations.
    A further point of interest in the account is the analogy between
vegetable and animal life. The doxographer applies to trees the word
(3%«) usually confined to animals, probably because it appeared in
Empedocles. For him, with his belief in the kinship of all life, there was
no firm distinction. One may compare his own expression ‘tall olive-
trees bear eggs’ (fr. 79), the assertion in fr. 82 that hair, leaves, scales
and the wings of birds are ‘the same’, and the description of the ear as
a ‘shoot (or sprout, &305) of flesh’ (Theophr. De sensu 9, 486). Accord-
ing to the De plantis both heand Anaxagoras attributed desire, pleasure
and pain to plants, and the latter, as well as Democritus and Plato,
called them ‘earth-rooted animals’.* The paralle]l between young plants
and embryos is echoed in the Hippocratic treatise On the Nature of the
Child (277, viL. 528 Littré):
All things that grow in the eacth live off the moisture in the earth, and the
moisture in them depends on the moisture in it.* So also the child lives off
its mother in the womb, and its health depends on hers. If anyone considers
what has been said on this subject from beginning to end, he will find a
similarity between the whole nature of the products of the earth and those
of human generation.

These remarks may               owe     something        to Empedocles,          but are more
reasonably taken as arising out of the old and very general belief in
the earth as the original mother of all living things alike. The same
analogy is turned into nonsense by Aristophanes in the Clouds (232),
where the word           ‘moisture’ (ikuds) plays a part as in the Hippocratic

    * [Axist] De plantis 8t     15, Plut. Qu.nac. 911 d (DK, 31       70, 59 4 116). Cf. Plato, Tim,

writer : ‘ The earth draws to itself perforce the moisture of the mind—the
same phenomenon may be observed in cress.”
   The full significance of the analogy between animal and plant life
comes out in the religious poem, where we learn that the same soul
may migrate from one to the other (frr. 117 and r27; p. 250 below).
   This evolution of life in the world of Strife, as it emerges when
stages (iti) and (iv) of Aétius are combined with                       the fragments of
Empedocles himself, has many points of resemblance to other accounts,
notably the anonymous one retailed by Diodorus in the first century
B.c.! According to this, the earth at its first formation was soft and
muddy. The sun’s warmth caused its surface to ¢ ferment’, and some of
the wet parts swelled up and produced a kind of bubbles with a thin
skin. These grew and developed, absorbing nourishment at night from
the marsh-mists and hardening by day under the heat of the sun. When
fully developed, the membranes were burst by the heat and ‘all kinds
of animals were born’.             Subsequently, as in Agtius’s report of Em-
pedacles, those containing most heat grew wings and took 1o the air,
the earthy became reptiles and other animals, and the moist ook to
the water. Later still, the earth became too hard to generate in this way
and animals were reproduced by copulation with each other. A similar
report is given by Lucretius (5.805fL.).
   These late and derivative accounts no doubt owed much to
Empedocles himself, though Anatimander had already described the
earliest animals as born in warmed moisture and enclosed in a kind of
‘bark’, which split as they came to dryer surroundings (430; vol. 1,
102). Possibly one may restore some of the missing parts of Em-
pedocles from these other accounts in the same tradition. What he said
about the transition from the ‘whole-natured forms’ to men, women
and animals has not survived. Simplicius however, following up
Aristotle’s anachronistic claim that they must in fact have consisted of
   " Diod. 1.7. The origins of the cosmogony and zoogony of Diodorus are a matter of lively
controversy. W. Spoerri has devoted a book to che subject, Spathellenistische Berichte iber Welt,
Kulewr und Goster (x959), 0 which teferences will be found. He believes that Diodorus has
worked his material into a systematic whole which shows unmistakable signs of the thought of
his own period. This however 1s not undisputed, and the chapter certainly contans passages of
purely Presocratic matter some of which must be traceable to Empedocles.       For a summary of
recent discussion see my Jn the Beginning, 132, 1. 10 and review of Spoerti i Gotz, Gel, Ang.

sperma, says that ‘whole-natured” is a very good description of sperma,
since it, like them, contains the form of man in potentiality and is every
part of the body in an undiscriminated state; ‘whereas’, he continues,
‘no part of the body is the other parts once separation has taken place
among them and the whole-natured has been torn apart’ (Phys. 382)." It
is a probable inference that the ‘whole-natured forms’ which grew out
of the earth were these “wombs’ as the Epicureans later called them, in
which, as the work of separating-out” proceeded (the action of Strife
reminds us once again of the ekkrisis of Anaximander), the various
forms of animal life could develop.?


   L.   THE    STRUCTURE           OF    ANIMATE         NATURE:         PHYSIOLOGY

                              (1) The ratio of the mixture
To explain organic tissues Empedocles makes use of the characteristic-
ally Pythagorean notion of proportionate mixture. Living things at
Jeast are compounded of the elements in certain definable mathematical
ratios. This proportion Aristotle calls the logos of the mixture, which,
whether the word was used by Empedocles or not,3 enables him to take
advantage of its ambiguity to relate the theory to his own system of
causation.
   In the first chapter of De partibus animalium Aristotle is defending
his favourite thesis that the ‘nature’ of anything, defined here as its
completed structure,* is 2 principle or cause prior to the matter.                             At
642a17 he says:
Itis the nature of a thing, rather than its matter, which is 2 principle (arche).
Empedocles too sometimes hits upon this principle, guided by the truch
itself, and is compelled to assert that the essence or nature is the logos, for
instance when he explains what bone is; for he defines it not as one of the
elements, or two or three or all of them, but as the logos of their mixture.
   ¥ SiaomactivTas Ta¥ obhoguols. In Anaximander, A0      (Aétius) we have wepippnyvuptvou ol

  ? The inference is drawn by Bignone, Emped. 580-4. The ‘wombs rooted in the earth® occur
inLucr. (5. 808)and Censorinus, De die nat. (4-9). R. Philippson in Phil. Woch. 1929, 672f., pro-
duced some evidence to suggest that they originated with Democritus. It is relevant to compare
the embryological analogy applied to trees in Aétius’s version of Empedocles.

                                        FEmpedocles
This ratio, then, is what constitutes bone. It is what Aristotle calls the
form or essence of bone, its logos in the sense of definition, as opposed
to its matter, that is, the elements which are combined in the specific
ratio,
    Repeating this information in De anima (410ar1), Aristotle quotes
the actual formula of Empedocles for bone:                                           .
Each of these [compound badies] consists of the elements not in any hap-
hazard state, bur in a certain proportion and mode of composition, as
Empedocles says of bone:
   ‘The kindly earth received in its broad melting-pots®    fwo parts of
the glitter of Nestis out of eight, and four of Hephaestu?/; and they
became white       bones,     wondrously        joined    by   the cement       ofi Harmonia®
(r. 96).2

Thus bone consists of four parts of fire, two of water, and two of earth
to make up the total of eight. The preponderance of fire may have been
suggested, as Simplicius thought, by the whiteness and dry hardness of
bone3 Aétius (5.22.1, 478) gives the formula for certain other animal
tissues as well:
Empedocles says that flesh ariginates from the four elements mixed in equal
quantities, sinews from fire and earth mixed with double the quantity of
water, the claws or nails of animals from the sinews in so far as these are
chilled by contact with the air, bones from two parts of water and earth 1o
four of fire, these parts being mixed within the earth.s

  ¥ xéavos *melting-pot’ rather than ‘funnel’ as at has most often been translated in English,
Cf. Hom. 1/ 18. 470, Hes. Th. 863, The metaphor 15 from metal-working. (See also Solmsen in
JHI, 1963, 477.) The ranslanon ‘funnels’ has probably been influenced by the belief that (as is
na doubt true) the reality hehind the metaphaor is che wdpor o tiny channels which make nuxnuce
possible (pp. 1501, above).
   * The last line is added by Simplicius, Phys. 300.24.
   3 Simplicius (De an. 68, see Emped. fr. 96) also says that the formula is in fact 4 of fire, 2 of
earth and t each of air and warcer. He supposes that Nestis is here used to cover both of the last
two. This is scatcely possible, though it would explain a troublesome little point, namely why
Empedocles should speak of a proportion of 4:2:2 rather than 2:1:3. Theophrastus also (De
sensu, 23) speaks of both bane and hair a5 comprismg ‘all the elements’.       See however Aetius
abave. (This modifies a staterent in vol. 1, p. 275, 1. 2)
   * Further light is thrown on the last few words by the summary of cosmogony in the Hippo~
cratic De carnibus, ch. 3 (viH, 536 Litird), which seems to owe something to Empedocles: * With
a long period of heat, what was formed from the putrefaction of the earth and was fatty and re~
tained the smallest quantity of moisture was most quickly burned up and became bones.” The
theory of the origin of life from a primitive ‘ putrefaction” of the earth appears in a variery of
authorities. For its currency 1n Presocratic thought cf. Plato, Phaeds, 9Gb.

                                                212
             Physiology: the Structure of Organic Tissues
   Of these examples we have the first in Empedocles’s own words
(fr. o8):
Earth chanced in about equal quantity upon these, Hephaestus, water, and
shining aither, anchored in the perfect harbours of Cypris, either a litde
more or a litcle less among more of them.’ From these arose blood and the
various forms of flesh.”
   Cornford3 was strongly of the opinion that the principle of specific
ratios was confined to organic compounds: it is the presence of definite
numerical proportion that distinguishes living creatures and their parts
from inorganic masses. He thought it probable that the tissues of plants
were included, since these also have life and soul, but nothing else.
Millerd too (Emped. 40f.) saw no evidence that the principle was
generalized, and used this as an argument against those who, like
Gomperz, have claimed for Empedocles that he anticipated the modern
chemical principle of proportional combination,                             She herself would
confine it to the actual examples mentioned (bone, blood, flesh, sinew),
and held that the phrase used by Aristotle—*/ogos of the mixture’—
has given to modern interpreters a false impression of universality.
Bignone on the other hand maintained that fir. 23* and 71 (which he
said are to be connected) at once extend the principle to the whole
animal and vegetable world, and in fact the “harmonious mixture’ of
fr. 23 implicitly affirms its universality.

as if blood ieself were a form of flesh, as indeed it must have been since the same formula applies
10 both. The Greek word céef, which from Homer onwards was used regularly in the plural,
covered a wider field than our *flesh’. (Cf. the eontent of the Hippocratic De carnibus.) Presum-
ably however blocd contained a larger proportion of water than did flesh. Perhaps Empedocles
intended 1o allow for this with his *about equal” and “a little more or a little less’. These phrases
at feast confess that the dacrrine of strict proportion as constituting the essensial hstincuon
berween specific organic subatances was refaxed to take account of observed differences within
what was regarded as a single kind. The same may have been dane for bone: cf. the distinction
drawn in De carn. between the compasition of salid and porous boaes (vi, §88 L.). (Bignone,
Ermped. 469 1., suggested that the language of approximation was used 1o allow for the presence
 of Love as well as the elements. Although Love was certainly present, I do not think this 3 likely
 way of alluding 10 the fact.)

Cyptis, which is the cause of a// mixture. She it is who joins zhings
together (ouvappdzet, of Aphrodite in fr.71. 4), and in this case it would
seem that neither the noun nor the verb can be confined to the special
sense of ‘combine in fixed proportion’. As a common noun, on the
other hand, at least for the Pythagoreans with whom Empedocles had
strong affinities, it connotes combination in mathematical ratio (vol. 1,
220, 223), and that is how Bignone regarded it in the simile of the
mixing of paints in fr. 23.4: ‘mixing them in Aarmonia, more of these
and less of those”.   Indeed his whole belief in the universality of the
principle depends on this. Yet what painter ever obtained his desired
shade by conforming to a recipe which laid down a numerical propor-
tion between the pigments, like a dispenser making up a‘medical
prescription? The thought is rather of the harmonious, that is pleasing,
effect produced than of the means of its production.
   Aristotle, it is said, provides evidence that Empedocles did not apply
propartion universally, for he censures him on this account as in-
consistent.   In the Metaphysics he sums up his review of the early
thinkers by saying that they were all groping after the four aspects of
causation in which he himself believed, but could not state them clearly
at a time when philosophy was still in its lisping infancy.
So Empedocles (he continues (993 a17)] says bone exists by the logos; that
is, the essence and substance of the thing. But it was equally necessary that
flesh and everything else should be the logos, or else none of them. That will
be the cause of flesh and bone and everything else—not the matter that he
alleges, fire and earth and water and air. If anyone else had said so, he would
have had to agree, but he has not put it clearly.
    This is a criticism on grounds of inadequate and obscure expression.
Empedocles, it would seem, stated the ratio of mixture of the elements
of a few organic substances like bone, and emphasized that it was this
ratio that imparted their specific character to them; but in the case of
most other substances he was content to name their elements alone,
although if the point had been put to him, he would have had to agree
that their specific character depended also on the proportions in which
these elements occurred. This is obvious, since otherwise it would have
been impossible to produce the manifold variety of nature from four
elements only.

                            Thke Logos of the Mixture
   Elsewhere Aristotle seems to say that Empedocles’s theory demands
a rationally proportionate mixture in every compound substance (De
an. 409b32):
It is the same with any other compound at all. Each of them consists of the
elements not in any haphazard state, but in a certain Jogos and mode of
composition, as for instance Empedocles says of bone. . ..
So also Simplicius introduces fr. 96 by saying (Phys. 300.19): ‘He
makes flesh and bone and o/l the rest by a certain logos.”
   In the absence of the philosopher’s own words, any interpretarion
of this evidence must be hazardous. It seems most likely however that
Empedocles believed all natural substances, metals and minerals as well
as organic tissues, to be differentiated from one another by a different
proportion of the four common elements in their mixture.                               He gave
only a few examples of this?all from the highest and most important
stratum of existence, namely animal life, and was upbraided by Aristotle
for neglecting to extend these explanations further; but his Pythagorean
faith in the kinship of all nature makes it improbable that he regarded
inanimate objects as composed on an entirely different basis from
animate. The difference would be one of degree, and would amount to
this, that the lower anything was in the scala naturae the more unequal
would be the balance of the elements within it. This is suggested by the
fact that the highest manifestation of physical life, namely rational
thought, has for its organ the blood,3 in which the elements display the
nearest possible proportions to those in the divine Sphere, namely one
to one4 Love is the power which unites different elements with each
other. It has been shown earlier (p. 161) that the products of these
  ' Aristotle’s argument concerns those who say that perception is of like by like (as e.g.
Empedocles in fr. 109). This leads to the absurd conclusion that the percesving soul must contain
the subsrance of all dhe infinite aumber of things which it perceives. It is no use saying simply
that it cantatns the fouc elements out of which they are all composed, for how then could it be
aware of the objects as separate wholes? Their specific character depends not on the common
elements but on the logos in which in each separate case they are combined.
  The words xal 7&v &My &eaTov in Simplicius might mean only ‘each of the other organic
tissites”, but in the light of Aristotle’s reference 10 &Aho émiolv Tév auwdETey should probably be
interpreted more widely.

unions, in a world where Love is opposed by Strife, are chance effects,
and there is nothing in the evidence here considered to alter that con-
clusion. The precise description of the proportions constituting certain
selected organic tissues might give the impression that Love was
working alone to produce those particular blends, but there is no reason
to distinguish the principle underlying their structure from that which
brought about any other compound substances. To demonstrate that
Empedocles ‘says that the parts of animals also came into being by
chance’, Simplicius (Pkys. 331.5) quotes among other exarpples the
first line of fr. 98 describing the composition of blood itself. Yet at the
same time he can say (300.25) apropos the composition ofjbone in
fr. 96: *That is, it happens by divine causation, mostly by Love or
Harmonia, for it is by her cement that they are joined.” Aristotle saw
no answer to his question: ‘Is Love the cause of any chance mixture,
or of mixture according to logos?’ The answer is that it is only from
his own teleological viewpoint that there is any essential difference
between chance and logos. The latter word, with its double significance
of ‘proportion” and ‘formal-final cause’, is his own importation.

                (2) Medicine and physiology: reproduction
The Sicilian school of medicine took its place alongside those of Cos,
Cnidus and Rhodes, and Empedocles was generally looked on as its
founder. Galen wrote:
In former days there was great rivalry between Cos and Cnidus as they
endeavoured to outdo each other in the number of their discoveries. These
were the ¢wo surviving branches of Asclepiads after the decline of Rhodes,
and they werejoined in that ‘noble wrangling’, which Hesiod eulogized, by the
physicians of Italy, Philistion, Empedocles, Pausanias and their colleagues.
There were then these three impressive groups of physicians competing with
each other. The Coan schaol was foctunate in having the most and the best
practitioners, but the Cnidian ran it close, and the Italian too was of no small
merit.


Philistion, an influential physician and writer on medicine in the fourth
century, was a native of Locri, but was also referred to as * the Sicilian’
from his connexion with the schaol. It was, says Pliny, known from
its reliance on observation as the empirical school,and began with Acron

                             Medicine and Physiology
of Acragas who owed his reputation to the fact that (like Pausanias)
he was a pupil of Empedocles.*
  In the surviving remains of Empedocles there is little information
about disease or its therapy; but we have not only his claim to impart
such information in frr. 111 and 112 (p. 132 above), but also evidence
of a consuming interest in the body and its functions. The influence of
his physiological theory is obvious in what we know of the theories of
later physicians like Philistion and Diocles, and of Plato himself. In
this respect the Timaeus owes an obvious debt to Empedocles, partly
at least through the medium of Philistion with whom in all probability
Plato was personally acquainted.?
   The arrangement of the elements in organic bodies, which is the
work of Love, is illustrated by examples of flesh-covered creatures and
those which have hard parts on the ouside. In the latter it differs, he
points out, from the order of the main masses in the world, which are
already largely the work of Strife and forecast the order that they will
assume when entirely separated.
(Fr.75) Those of them that are solid within and rare without, having got
this flaccidity in the hands of Cypris.
(Fr. 76) This you find in the heavy-backed shells of the sea-dwellers,
tritons and turtles of stony hide. There you will see earth [the heaviest ele-
ment] lying on the surface of the skin.
   Empedocles        shows     especial interest in animal reproduction.                      He
believed that the female as well as the male provides semen, different
parts of the offspring being formed from the semen of each (fr. 63,
Arist. G4, 722b10). The necessity for a correct mixture of the two
suggested to him an explanation of the sterility of mules, though we
have only Aristotle’s account of this,3 and he confesses to having found
it obscure. The reason as he gives it (G4, 747234) is that though the
semen of hoth horse and ass is soft, their mixture solidifies as the

   3 Aet. 5.14.2 (DK, 482) must be rejected. It is incansistent with Aristotle and seems to be
due to confusion with another philosopher (Bignone, Emped. 366, n. 2; Lesky, Zeugungslehren,
31, 0. 1}, On symmetry of pores and stenlicy of mules ¢f. ZN, 991, a. 1.

 ‘hollows’ of each fit into the dense parts of the other. This type of
 mixture, Empedocles says, makes soft bodies hard, as happens when
 copper is alloyed with tin. (Even this explanation of the hardness of
 bronze is wrong, remarks Aristotle.) The passage affords yet another
 instance of how he applied his general principles (in this case the
 doctrine of ‘symmetry of pores’, pp. 150f. abave) to & particular case.
    Sex is determined by temperature, males being hotter than females.®
 So Aristotle (GA, 764 a1):                                                             :
 Others claim that the differentiation of sex takes place within thEe womb,?
 Thus Empedocles says that what enters a hot womb hecomes miale, what
 enters a cold womb female. The heat or coldness is determined byithe flow
of the menses, which may be either colder or hotter, older or more recent.
Again at 765 a8: ‘ We must also face the argument of Empedocles, who
differentiates male from female by the heat of the womb.” This applies
to the original formation of animals within the earth as well as to the
embryo in the womb. Of Empedocles himself we have the following
lines: (fr. 65) *And it was poured out in the purified paris;4 some
become women, when they have met with cold...” and (fr. 67.1)
“For in the warmer part of the earth appeared that which engendered
the male’.5
   Muliiple births were due to superabundance and division of the
semen.      Family resemblances ‘follow the preponderance of the seed’;

   * Arist. P,      648 2 29-31, quoted   on p. 78 above.   See Lesky,   op. <it. 31,   Die Warme-
cheorie des Empedakles.

   3 Empedocles himself may have been mare lucid than this summary of him, Presumnably the
meaning 15, as Platc says (ad foc. in Oxford trans.), that if conception takes place directly after
menstruation the offspring is male, if later fernale. But accarding to Galen (ad fr. 67) it was a
question of the right-hand s'de of the womb being warmer than the left, whereas the words of
Censorinus (5.4, DK, 481) would seem ta imply that sex depended on the semen coming frara
the right (male) or left (female) testicle. At least ‘ex dextris partibus profuso semine” does not
appear 10 refer to the receiving womb. (See also G. E. R. Lloyd in JHS, 1962, 6o, n. 19. He
thinks Censorinus’s interpretation should probably be ruled our) Empedocles’s own statement
has not sutvived.

a lack of resemblance to either parent results ‘when the heat of the
semen has evaporated”.*
   In human beings the differentiation of the parts in the embryo begins
from the thirty-sixth day and is complete from the forty-ninth, Male
embryos take shape more quickly than female, and the right-hand parts
than the left. The heart is the first organ to be formed, because it above
all contains the life of a man. The navel brings together four vessels,
two venous and two arterial, through which sanguineous and breathy
material is conveyed to nourish the embryos.                             These substances
according to Empedocles originate in the liver.?
   He believed that menstruation occurs in women when the moon is
waning, a superstitious idea with which Aristotle is rather surprisingly
inclined to agree, though more tentatively. Aristotle also gives a
reason, which since it is connected with change of temperature is likely
10 have weighed with Empedocles before him.3
   Of the drawing of the infant’s first breath Aétius reports (4.22.1,
AT4):
Empedocles says that the first breathing of the ffirst?] living creature is
[was?) caused! by the retreat of the moisture in the infants and the entering
  ¥ Agt. 5.10.¥ and 11.1 (A8x). The meaning of the clause about resemblances may be inferred
from the fuller statement of the Hippocratic De genitura 8 (Vi1 480 L.): semen is provided by the
bodies of both parents, and those parts of the offspring which contain more of the seed of one
parent will resemble the corresponding parts of that parent. But according to Empedocles tem-
perature was effective here toq, as well as in determining sex, if we may trust Censorinus.   (81,
but see Lesky, ap. cit. 36f. on these passages.)
   * All these sratements depend on secondary sources, Aétius, Censorinus and Soranus. See
483, 84,79. On the question which organ was formed first, opinion in the fifth century differed
according to the view taken of what was the central and most vital organ, Thus Alemaeon (A13)
and Anaxagoras (A 108) said 1t was the brain. For Democritus see p. 467 below.
  3 Soranus (early second century A.n.) quoted in A80, Arist. G, 738164, repeated at 767az2
and Hd, j82a34. Other physicians, says Soranus, thought menstruation more litely to occur at
full moon (Wellmann, FG4, 1.197), whereas he himself took the sensible view that the fime of
onsex difiered for different women.

                                      (3) Respiration
On respiration in general we have one of Empedocles’s most picturesque
passages (fr. 100).        Modern interpretations of it differ, and the differ-
ences affect the rranslation itself. The following translation%is based on
that of N. B. Booth, and goes against the view generally accepted until
recently, though this had already been challenged by D.k]. Furley.”
Whatever interpretation is adopted, one must admit that Empedocles
does not seem to have thoughr of all the problems raised by his
theory and that his poetical language is a1 some points irretrievably
vague.
This is the way that all creatures breathe in and out. All animals have tubes
of flesh, containing little blood, stretched our deep inside the body.* At their
mouths the furthest ends of the nostrils3 are pierced through with close-set
holes, so that the blood is kept out but a free pathway for air is opened
through the passages. Then whenever the delicate blood runs away from
here, the blustering air rushes in with furious surge, but when it leaps back,
the animal breathes out. It is as when a girl plays with a water-lifter (clepsy-
drd) of shining bionze> </p>

          XK.   THE    FORMATION             OF    LIVING        CREATURES
<p>We have already seen how in general, ‘chemical’ terms the' various
forms of life arise. What is truly existent cannot be born or perish or
change, but strictly speaking only the four elementary substances exist:
life resules from mixtures of these substances in certain proportions.
According to the stage in the cosmic cycle at which it occuts, a thing
may both be born and perish by either the coming together or the
dissolution of the elements (fr. 17.3—5).                   Into this new framework are
fitted the current ideas (going back to Anaximander, and in mytho-
logical form further stilt) of life as originating in moistened earth under
the action of heat.          So in fr. 73 Love, the agent of mixture, mingles
earth with water, fashions the living creatures in it, and hardens them
by fire. Fr. 62 describes a similar process.
The evolution of animal life was related to the cosmic cycle in a way
<p>shar can be seen from a passage of Aétius supplemented by quotations
from Empedocles and other testimony. The doxographer does not
make it clear, as he was probably not clear himself, that he was describ-
ing, not a continuous evolution, but two contrary processes.                               Never-
theless the passage can be read as a concise summary of the Empedoclean
dactrine. 1t distinguishes four stages as follows.?
* Bignone (Emped. 427) has shown it to be probable that frr. 34 and 73 should be joined as the
<p>two halves of a simile. [<em>As a baker puts cakes in the oven], having cemented the meal with
water, so Cypris after she had moistened the earth with water, as she fashioned the forms of
living things gave them to swift fire 1o harden.” The custom of making cakes in the form of
animals and men would add pownt 10 the simile. Another simile describing the work of Lave
in forming compounds 15 fr. 33: ‘As when fig-juice fixes and binds white milk.' Fig-juice was
used as rennet, and the line is adapted from Homer, JZ §.90z. Here 1t may have a more par-
ticular physiolagical reference; f. Plut. Qu. naz. 9172 (478): ‘Some say that sears are ¢xcruded
like whey from milk when the blood is stirred up; so Empedocles.’

</em> AgL §.19.5 (A72). The passage has been the subject of considerable discussion, but since it
seems to admis of a straightforward interpretation references to ather views would be more likely
to cloud the issue than 1o clarify it. To mention only one of the most recent, Minar in Phronesis,
1963, 14f,, supposes all four stages in Agtius 1o be contained within the period of increasing
Love.   But his assumption that to do otherwise involves canfining sexual generation entirely to
the epoch of Strife places an entirely undeserved reliance on the completeness of the doxographer’s
summary. At the same time he has to explain the absence of information about the period of
increasing Surife as due at least in part to “the fragmentary natuxe of our wradition” (p. 143).</p>

<p>                       The Formation of Living Creatures
Empedocles says (i) the first generations of plants’ and animals were not
entire, bur divided, with parts not grown together; (i) the second, in which
the parts grew together, were like creatures of fantasy; (iif) the third was the
generation of the whole-natured; (iv) the fourth was no longer engendered
from the elements? like earth and water but from each other, when for some
their nourishment became thick and for others the beauty of women excited
the seminal motion.?           The     kinds of all living creatures        were distributed
according to the character of their mixture: some had a more natural inclina-
tion to water, as many as had a preponderance of fire flew up into the air,¢
the heavier made for the earth, and those in whose composition the elements
were equally balanced....5</p>
(i) This is the earliest stage of organic life in the period when Love
<p>is gaining and the process of evolution is from separation 16 combina~
tion. Empedocles describes it in the lines of fr. 57, which is expressly
ascribed by Aristotle to this period and by Simplicius to the first
stage of it:6
On the earth? many heads sprang up without necks, arms wandered bare,
bereft of shoulders, and eyes strayed alone in need of foreheads.</p>

<p>                                          Empedocles
This provides concrete illustrations of the fantastic situation ourlined
in fr. 20, taken from Simplicius (Phys. 1124.9):
Here too [sc. in the sublunary world] Empedocles says that Strife and
Love prevail in turn among men and fish and beasts and birds, when                                  he
writes:
*This is manifest throughout the mass of mortal bodies. At one time all
<p>the limbs which belong to the body, in the prime of blooming life, come
together into one through Love. At another, severed by evil spirits of dis-
cord, they wander, each separately, on the shores of life; and it i§ the same
for bushes, and fishes housed in water, and beasts with their mountain lairs
and birds of winged flight.”</p>
</p>
Aristotle’s criticism amplifies the picture slightly (G4 722bY7):
<p>Tt is impossible for large members                to survive and be alive in separation,
which is Empedocles’s account of generation under Love. ‘Many heads’, he
says, ‘ grew up without necks', and later they were joined together.?
Simplicius, in describing with the aid of fr. 35.9—13 the state of things
when Love was gaining but Strife still active and vigorous, adds:
In this state of things the members were still * single-Jimbed’ (formed of one
limb only]® from the separation wrought by Strife, and wandered abour
longing to combine with each other.</p>
 * This fr. is given a different application by Bignone, Emped. 410, but the interpretation of
<p>Diuels, which he stigmatizes as erroneous, is more likely 1o be right (at least in its general reference
to the evolutionary cycle, if not in detaif). Bignone’s objection to it (571, n. x) is that it includes
plants among the organisms whose parts once sprang up separately and were joined at random,
whereas Aristotle in a baaeering moad says that Empedocles should have mentioned ‘olive-
headed vines” as well as <em>man-headed oxen’ (Phys. 199b 10), and Simplicius ad Joe. (382.30)
confirms that he left them out. Ir is however scareely possible, considering his elaborate striving
after consistency, that Empedacles fatled to assurme the same process for plants as for animals,      If
he confined himself to a general reference like the above, Acistotle was still entitled to have his
joke about the man who specified the animal monsters (which were already well known in Greek
mythological tradition) but did not dare ta enumerace the surprising products of his scheme in the
plant wosld. The inclusion of plants by Aétius is some confirmation that this was so, Itis difficulr
to believe, as Bignone would have us do, that the words of fr. 20 describe the individual in health
and sickness. Still more improbable is the propoesition of Kranz, advanced without argument
{ Emped. 361), that the subject of these lines is sexual intercourse.

</em> Bignone (Emped. §69) sees here an affinity between Empedacies and the Orphic doctrine
cited by Acistotle, G4, 734216, that the parts of animals come into being not simultaneously but
one after the other, ‘like the weaving of a net’, There however Aristotle js referting to the forma~
tion of the foetus in the womb, not to Empedacles’s fantastic theory of the origin af Iife in another
part of the cosmic cycle.

<p>                   Living Creatures under Advancing Love
    “But when daimon engaged more and more with daiman’,’
<p>as Love continued to gain over Strife,
‘it came to pass both that these things* came together as each happened
<p>to meet, and also many others besides them sprang up in continuous suc-
cession” (fr. 59).
This fragment must have been written in close proximity to 35.16f.
And as they [the elements] mingled, a myriad kinds of mortal creatures were
brought forth, endowed with all sorts of shapes, a wonder 1o behold.
The chance coming together of the separate limbs and organs marks the
transition to the second stage. Similarly, Simplicius says elsewhere
(PPys. 371.33) that under the rule of Love, first the parts of animals
such as heads, hands and feet appeared here and there at random, tken
they came together and gave rise to the monsters about to be described.
 (i) For the second stage of Love’s advance we have four surviving
<p>lines of Empedocles (fr. 61):
Many were born with faces and breasts hoth front and back, oxen with the
heads of men, and conversely there sprang up creatures in human form with
the heads of oxen, and mixtures partly of men and partly of women’s nature,
fitted with shadowed3 [private] parts.
Plutarch preserves, along with the man-headed oxen, another phrase
(fr. 60): ‘shambling [cattle] with countless hands’.4
 It is at this stage that we have the theory of the survival of the
<p>fittest which some modern commentators have likened to Darwin’s.
No words of Empedocles on the subject have survived. Aristotle refers
to it briefly in a passage where he is setting forth, in order to refute it,
¥ That is, as the struggle between Love and Strife continued and intensified. The comments
<p>interpolated by Simplicius show that he ac least thought that they (not, as Zeller supposed, the
elements) are the Safpoves in question. For pioyeofo of engaging in combat cf. e.g. Hom. 77 4.456.

<p>meaning it occurs Jater without the noun in Theocritus 25.131. M. Timpanare Cardini (Physis,
1960, 8) thinks that by éxprréxapx Empedocles did not mean “with innumerable hands’ but “with
hands not articulated into separate fingers’, suitable appendages for mixed animal and human
creatutes. This is probable. The word is presumably modelled on the Homeric dwpiréguiios
and &amp;xpitéguvos.    The former (JZ 2. 868) undoubredly means that the leaves were plentiful, but
 does so by calling them *indistinguishable’. (Lieselotte Solmsen in Lex. d. frikgr. Epos, s.v.:
 ‘mit meht zu unterscheidenden, dichten Blattern.”) dxpirépeovos is applied to the speech of
 ‘Thersites in 7/, 2. 246, Where confusion rather than profusion seems to be in point.</p>

the anti-teleological view according to which any apparent signs of
purpose in nature (e.g. that front teeth should be sharp for biting, and
the molars flat to reduce the food to a digestible smoothness) are in
fact only fortuitous.
Similarly [he continues (Pfys. 198 b27)] with other organs in which we seem
to see a purpose. Where everything turned out in a way which simulated
purpose, those creatures survived because 8y chance they were constituted in
a suitable way; whereas all that were not so constituted perished, and con-
tinue to perish, as Empedocles says the ‘man-headed oxen’ d(:d.
Commenting on this passage, Simplicius is rather more !\nformative.
<p>After quoting fr. 62, vv. 2~3, he continues (Phys. 371.33):
Empedocles says that during the rule of Love first of all there came into
being at random parts of animals such as heads, hands and feet, and then
there came together those ‘oxen with the heads of men’, <em>and conversely
there sprang up’, naturally, ‘men with the heads of oxen’, that is, com-
pounded of ox and man. Asmany of these parts as were fitted together
in such a way as to ensure their preservation became animals and survived,
because they fulfilled mutual needs—the teeth tearing and softening food,
the stomach digesting it, and the liver converting it into blood. The human
head, when it meets a human body, ensures the preservation of the whole,
but being inappropriate to the ox-body it leads to its disappearance. All that
did not come together according to the proper formula [logos] perished.
Whatever         the    superficial     resemblances         of    this   conception         to
<p>nineteenth-century theories of evolution, it was obviously reached

</em> They were probably rated most highly by Gomperz, Gr. Thinkers, 1, 244, We mnst at least
agree that they represent an attempt to explain the apparent evidence of design in nature by
purely natural, or, as the Greeks would say, ‘necessary’ causes, This reliance on blind automatism
and neglect of the final cause in Empedocles is repeatedly castigated by Aristotle. That is the
intention of his criticism at Phys. 199bg. Cf. also 196a20—5, GC, 313b15, Metaph. 1000b12,
De caelo, 300b25-30, PA, 610219, De resp. 473215.
Fora sceptical view see Millerd, Emped. 58, She thought that Simplicius was mistakenly attri-
<p>buting to Empedocles a view which Aristotle assigned ta athers, with only a purely incidental
mention of Empedocles. This is perhaps a possible way of reading Phys. 193b27, but T do not
think it a likely one, especially in view of his criticism of Empedocles on the same ground else-
where. Nor do I see the force of Zeller’s remark (ZN, 989, n. 3), approved by Millerd, that an
evolutionary theory based on chance could not appear until the teleolagical explanation had been
developed which it was intended to replace. Rather was the philosophic (as opposed to naive
mythological) expression of teleology developed by Socrates, Plato and Aristotle as a deliberate
attack on the automatism of earlier science. Luria, dnft d. gr. Denkens, 1963, 153, n. 208, also
takes an extreme sceptical view, but for a different assessment see M. Timpanaro Cardini in
Physis, 1960.</p>

from very different premises and formed an integral part of a cosmo-
logical system which by nineteenth-century standards was fanciful in
the extreme. It does not refer to development in the present wotld,
but to an era in which evolution proceeded in the opposite direction.
The monsters         described are reminiscent of various figures in Greek
mythology, and it is fair to assume that Empedocles had these in mind,
for he was always glad to show that his carefully constructed system
accounted for phenomena known or believed in by his countrymen.
The Minotaur provided a bull-headed man, and other mixed forms
included centaurs and the Chimaera (lion’s head, goat’s body, and
serpent’s tail). Bisexual beings were by no means confined to Herma-
phroditos, whose cult seems to have been introduced at Athens during
the fifth century. Considering the affinities of Empedocles’s doctrines,
some have been tempted to think also of Phanes, in Orphic literature
the creator and first ruler of the gods and the world. Orphic verses
described himn as bisexual and as having the heads of a ram, a bull, a
lion and a snake.® Butalthough Phanes himself might be said to belong
to the past, in so far as a god can (he was swallowed by Zeus), it is
hardly likely that Empedacles would have wished to include this great
cosmic figure among the transient non-viable creatures which his lines
describe. More obviously in the same tradition (whatever its origin)
are the early human beings comically described by Aristophanes in
Plato’s Symposium (189dff.). These were spherical in shape and in
every way double, with four hands, legs and ears, two faces, and the
sexual parts of both male and female.?
  ' See Guthrie, Orph. and Gk. Rel. 1o1f. and 145, nn. 24 and 25, for evidence for this paragraph.
  * Some have thought that they resemble rather the olhogusis of the early stages of Swrife’s
progress. The ‘wholeness’ of their androgynous nature, and their spherical shape, can be thought
o paint in this direction, and their modification into ordinary men and wornen was the result of a
drastic act of separation. Also it can be argued that the otdopueis, assuming that they were bio-
logically sufficiently advanced in the first place, would lead happier and better lives than our-
selves, since Love was more powerful then than now; and the Aristophanic hermaphrodites
were happier than their monosexual successors,
  Qn the other hand, (3) Aristophanes’s creatures have even more limbs and sexual paris than
we do, whereas the otiogueis have none; (2) bisexual beings occur among the monsters of fr. 613
(3) in Empedocles the human beings of an age when Love was more powerful were not only
happy but morally perfect and pious worshippers, whereas Aristophanes’s creatures were so
impious that they tried to scorm heaven and attack the gods. Plato’s mind was well stocked with
traditional motifs, but it is unwise to look 100 ¢losely at the tale which an imaginative genius puts
into the mouth of one of the greatest of comic poets. 1 cannot myself believe that the ottogusis
70mar had any kind of human form.      Cf. p. 211 below.</p>

<p>                                         Empedocles
From fr. 61 and the comments of Aristotle and Simplicius it follows
<p>that there was a third stage in the period of increasing Love, not men-
tioned by Aétius: when the monstrosities had been weeded out by
natural causes, there remained men, women and animals who were the
counterpart of those in our own era.r Since Love unites heterogeneous
elements, it is presumably to this stage that Aristotle refers when he
says that ‘the hottest animals, those containing most fire, ate aquatic,
to escape the excess of heat in their own nature’.<em> This is the contrary
of what is said at the end of the Aétius passage (p. 201 above), that
animals seek the element most akin to the one which preponderates in
themselves. That applies to the present era of increasing\Strife, in
which each element is attracted 1o its like.
(iif) The third stage mentioned by Agtius is an early stage in the
<p>advance of Strife. ' Whole-natured’ (or growing as a whole, oUAoguris)
is the word used by Empedocles himself in the following description
(fr. 62):
Come now and hear this, how fire as it was separated raised up the nocturnal3
scions of men and pitiable women: it is no erring or ignorant tale. Whole-
patured forms first sprang up from the earth, having a portion of both water
and heat. These the fire sent vp, wishing to come to its like. Not yet did
they display the comely shape of limbs, nor voice nor the part proper to
men.
Here we see the work of Strife in that fire, still mingled with the
<p>other elements, is being separated and impelled to reach its like, the

fire in the earth reaching outwards towards the large mass of fire at the
circumference of the cosmos. In this process curious living forms arise
compounded of earth mixed with water and fire, without limbs, organs,
or distinction of sex. The unifying force of Love is still strong.? The
fourth element of air is not mentioned (so Bignone suggested) because
air is a component of blood and fleshy tissue {fr. 98) which these living
masses do not yet possess.? It could be absorbed later from the sur-
rounding atmosphere.            It is likely enough that Empedocles took these
pains to impose consistency on his scheme, but in the choice of the
three elements he would also be influenced by ancient traditions of the
origins of life. In Hesiod (&amp;7ga, 59ff.) Zeus ordered the god of fire to
mix earth and water to make the first woman.                        For Anaximander life
arose from water and earth when they were heated. In Empedocles
fire retains the active role, as its heat penetrates the mixture.
 The general notion of earth as literally the mother, from within
<p>whom not only plants but also the first animals and men originated,
is of course so old and universal as hardly to need illustration. Among
the Greeks it is reflected in myths like that of Cadmus and the ‘sown
men’    of Thebes, of Jason sowing the dragon’s teeth, of many                              auto-
chthonous heroes and gegeneis (earthborn), of Deucalion and the re-
newal of the human race after the flood from <em>the bones of our mother’
(i.e. stones). Tales of the marriage of earth and sky symbolize the need
of water to make earth fertile. Serious beliefs in the spontaneous genera-
tion of small animals like mice from the earth were buttressed by the
conviction that the earth had in the past possessed even greater
generative powers.3
(iv) The fourth stage, a later one in the advance of Strife, is that in
<p>which we now live.            Advancing discrimination and articulation have
brought into being the familiar world of self-reproducing male and

</em> A weak point of Minar’s account in Phronesis, 1963, is the failure to see that sexual differ-
entiation, like any differentiation, is not a good but the work of Strife. Note the sexlessness of
the deny of frr. 29 and 134. That the sexes are artracted to one another may be Love's doing,
though Hippolytus says that their intercourse is the work      of Swife (see Ref. 7 29.22, 30.4,
PP- 214, 216 Wendland), buc that is a very different thing.

course is stll at work, but her power is weakening, and with the
effect of this in the human sphere we pass from the poem on nature to
the Purifications, which tells of the moral degeneration brought about
by increasing Strife. The remark in Aétius about women’s beauty may
be compared with a line of Empedocles which as printed in DK speaks
of the desire that comes upon a man through sight (fr. 64, quoted by
Plutarch in connexion with sexual love).!
What Empedocles said about trees may fittingly find a Place here,
<p>for besides having a considerable general interest, it shows them as a
kind of living fossil, a primitive form of life which has persi’?ted to the
present day.        Afrius paraphrases it thus (5.26.4, a70):
Empedocles says that trees were the first living things® to grow‘out of the
earth, before the sun was spread around? and day and night were distinguished.
Owing to the matching of the elements in their mixture, they corbined the
formula for male and female. They grow by being pushed up by the heat in
the earth, so that they are parts of the earth just as embryos in the belly are
paris of the womb. Fruits consist of the excess of water and fire in the plants.
Those that have insufficient moisture lose their leaves in summer as it
evaporates, but those that have more, like the laurel, clive and palm, retain
them.¢ Differences in flavour are due to the composition of the soil, and the
different ways in which the plants draw the homoeomerous substances from
that which nourishes them.5             So with vines, it is not the differences in the
vine that make a drinkable wine, but differences in the soil that sustains
them.
  <em> See Plut. Qu. Phys. g17c. The reference to sight is due to a conjecture by Wyttenbach.
Cataudella (Riv. d: filol. 1960, 128£.) suggests a reading closer to the MSS,, but [ find the allusion
to the aphrodssiac effects of the digestive process more in keeping with Catullan impudence (he
quotes Catullus 32.9 as a parallel) than with the present context. In any case Plucarch quotes the
line o illustrate the effects of proximuty, not satiety, which he has mentioned eaclier as a distinct
alternative.

<p>SpeAdTns Kpdoeeys and ouppetpla wopav. These enable the nourishment to flow smoothly and
regularly and so in sufficient quantity. Since the food is drawn from the earth in the form of
moisture, the two explanations are complementary. Plutarch’s describes the mechanism whereby
the evergreens obtain their larger supply of moisture.

<p>                                  The Nature of Trees
 Trees, then, are the nearest in the present world to the original
<p>‘whole-natured’ forms of life. Like them they are still rooted in the
earth, from which they are pushed up by the heat within it, and sdll
combine the characteristics of both sexes, because the persistent in-
fluence of Love combines their elements in a manner nearer to the per-
fect mixture of the Sphere than that of more recent formations.
 A further point of interest in the account is the analogy between
<p>vegetable and animal life. The doxographer applies to trees the word
(3%«) usually confined to animals, probably because it appeared in
Empedocles. For him, with his belief in the kinship of all life, there was
no firm distinction. One may compare his own expression ‘tall olive-
trees bear eggs’ (fr. 79), the assertion in fr. 82 that hair, leaves, scales
and the wings of birds are ‘the same’, and the description of the ear as
a ‘shoot (or sprout, &amp;305) of flesh’ (Theophr. De sensu 9, 486). Accord-
ing to the De plantis both heand Anaxagoras attributed desire, pleasure
and pain to plants, and the latter, as well as Democritus and Plato,
called them ‘earth-rooted animals’.<em> The paralle]l between young plants
and embryos is echoed in the Hippocratic treatise On the Nature of the
Child (277, viL. 528 Littré):
All things that grow in the eacth live off the moisture in the earth, and the
moisture in them depends on the moisture in it.</em> So also the child lives off
its mother in the womb, and its health depends on hers. If anyone considers
what has been said on this subject from beginning to end, he will find a
similarity between the whole nature of the products of the earth and those
of human generation.</p>

</p>
<p>These remarks may               owe     something        to Empedocles,          but are more
reasonably taken as arising out of the old and very general belief in
the earth as the original mother of all living things alike. The same

same phenomenon may be observed in cress.”
The full significance of the analogy between animal and plant life
<p>comes out in the religious poem, where we learn that the same soul
may migrate from one to the other (frr. 117 and r27; p. 250 below).
This evolution of life in the world of Strife, as it emerges when
<p>stages (iti) and (iv) of Aétius are combined with                       the fragments of
Empedocles himself, has many points of resemblance to other accounts,
notably the anonymous one retailed by Diodorus in the first century
B.c.! According to this, the earth at its first formation was soft and
muddy. The sun’s warmth caused its surface to ¢ ferment’, and some of
the wet parts swelled up and produced a kind of bubbles with a thin
skin. These grew and developed, absorbing nourishment at night from
the marsh-mists and hardening by day under the heat of the sun. When
fully developed, the membranes were burst by the heat and ‘all kinds
of animals were born’.             Subsequently, as in Agtius’s report of Em-
pedacles, those containing most heat grew wings and took 1o the air,
the earthy became reptiles and other animals, and the moist ook to
the water. Later still, the earth became too hard to generate in this way
and animals were reproduced by copulation with each other. A similar
report is given by Lucretius (5.805fL.).
These late and derivative accounts no doubt owed much to
<p>Empedocles himself, though Anatimander had already described the
earliest animals as born in warmed moisture and enclosed in a kind of
‘bark’, which split as they came to dryer surroundings (430; vol. 1,
102). Possibly one may restore some of the missing parts of Em-
pedocles from these other accounts in the same tradition. What he said
about the transition from the ‘whole-natured forms’ to men, women
and animals has not survived. Simplicius however, following up
Aristotle’s anachronistic claim that they must in fact have consisted of
&quot; Diod. 1.7. The origins of the cosmogony and zoogony of Diodorus are a matter of lively
<p>controversy. W. Spoerri has devoted a book to che subject, Spathellenistische Berichte iber Welt,
Kulewr und Goster (x959), 0 which teferences will be found. He believes that Diodorus has
worked his material into a systematic whole which shows unmistakable signs of the thought of
his own period. This however 1s not undisputed, and the chapter certainly contans passages of
purely Presocratic matter some of which must be traceable to Empedocles.       For a summary of
recent discussion see my Jn the Beginning, 132, 1. 10 and review of Spoerti i Gotz, Gel, Ang.

sperma, says that ‘whole-natured” is a very good description of sperma,
since it, like them, contains the form of man in potentiality and is every
part of the body in an undiscriminated state; ‘whereas’, he continues,
‘no part of the body is the other parts once separation has taken place
among them and the whole-natured has been torn apart’ (Phys. 382)." It
is a probable inference that the ‘whole-natured forms’ which grew out
of the earth were these “wombs’ as the Epicureans later called them, in
which, as the work of separating-out” proceeded (the action of Strife
reminds us once again of the ekkrisis of Anaximander), the various
forms of animal life could develop.?</p>
L.   THE    STRUCTURE           OF    ANIMATE         NATURE:         PHYSIOLOGY
                           (1) The ratio of the mixture
<p>To explain organic tissues Empedocles makes use of the characteristic-
ally Pythagorean notion of proportionate mixture. Living things at
Jeast are compounded of the elements in certain definable mathematical
ratios. This proportion Aristotle calls the logos of the mixture, which,
whether the word was used by Empedocles or not,3 enables him to take
advantage of its ambiguity to relate the theory to his own system of
causation.
In the first chapter of De partibus animalium Aristotle is defending
<p>his favourite thesis that the ‘nature’ of anything, defined here as its
completed structure,* is 2 principle or cause prior to the matter.                             At
642a17 he says:
Itis the nature of a thing, rather than its matter, which is 2 principle (arche).
Empedocles too sometimes hits upon this principle, guided by the truch
itself, and is compelled to assert that the essence or nature is the logos, for
instance when he explains what bone is; for he defines it not as one of the
elements, or two or three or all of them, but as the logos of their mixture.

  ? The inference is drawn by Bignone, Emped. 580-4. The ‘wombs rooted in the earth® occur
inLucr. (5. 808)and Censorinus, De die nat. (4-9). R. Philippson in Phil. Woch. 1929, 672f., pro-
duced some evidence to suggest that they originated with Democritus. It is relevant to compare
the embryological analogy applied to trees in Aétius’s version of Empedocles.

This ratio, then, is what constitutes bone. It is what Aristotle calls the
form or essence of bone, its logos in the sense of definition, as opposed
to its matter, that is, the elements which are combined in the specific
ratio,
 Repeating this information in De anima (410ar1), Aristotle quotes
<p>the actual formula of Empedocles for bone:                                           .
Each of these [compound badies] consists of the elements not in any hap-
hazard state, bur in a certain proportion and mode of composition, as
Empedocles says of bone:
‘The kindly earth received in its broad melting-pots®    fwo parts of
<p>the glitter of Nestis out of eight, and four of Hephaestu?/; and they
became white       bones,     wondrously        joined    by   the cement       ofi Harmonia®
(r. 96).2</p>
</p>
</p>
<p>Thus bone consists of four parts of fire, two of water, and two of earth
to make up the total of eight. The preponderance of fire may have been
suggested, as Simplicius thought, by the whiteness and dry hardness of
bone3 Aétius (5.22.1, 478) gives the formula for certain other animal
tissues as well:
Empedocles says that flesh ariginates from the four elements mixed in equal
quantities, sinews from fire and earth mixed with double the quantity of
water, the claws or nails of animals from the sinews in so far as these are
chilled by contact with the air, bones from two parts of water and earth 1o
four of fire, these parts being mixed within the earth.s</p>
<p>  ¥ xéavos <em>melting-pot’ rather than ‘funnel’ as at has most often been translated in English,
Cf. Hom. 1/ 18. 470, Hes. Th. 863, The metaphor 15 from metal-working. (See also Solmsen in
JHI, 1963, 477.) The ranslanon ‘funnels’ has probably been influenced by the belief that (as is
na doubt true) the reality hehind the metaphaor is che wdpor o tiny channels which make nuxnuce
possible (pp. 1501, above).

</em> The last line is added by Simplicius, Phys. 300.24.
3 Simplicius (De an. 68, see Emped. fr. 96) also says that the formula is in fact 4 of fire, 2 of
<p>earth and t each of air and warcer. He supposes that Nestis is here used to cover both of the last
two. This is scatcely possible, though it would explain a troublesome little point, namely why
Empedocles should speak of a proportion of 4:2:2 rather than 2:1:3. Theophrastus also (De
sensu, 23) speaks of both bane and hair a5 comprismg ‘all the elements’.       See however Aetius
abave. (This modifies a staterent in vol. 1, p. 275, 1. 2)
* Further light is thrown on the last few words by the summary of cosmogony in the Hippo~
<p>cratic De carnibus, ch. 3 (viH, 536 Litird), which seems to owe something to Empedocles: * With
a long period of heat, what was formed from the putrefaction of the earth and was fatty and re~
tained the smallest quantity of moisture was most quickly burned up and became bones.” The
theory of the origin of life from a primitive ‘ putrefaction” of the earth appears in a variery of
authorities. For its currency 1n Presocratic thought cf. Plato, Phaeds, 9Gb.</p>

<p>             Physiology: the Structure of Organic Tissues
Of these examples we have the first in Empedocles’s own words
<p>(fr. o8):
Earth chanced in about equal quantity upon these, Hephaestus, water, and
shining aither, anchored in the perfect harbours of Cypris, either a litde
more or a litcle less among more of them.’ From these arose blood and the
various forms of flesh.”
Cornford3 was strongly of the opinion that the principle of specific
<p>ratios was confined to organic compounds: it is the presence of definite
numerical proportion that distinguishes living creatures and their parts
from inorganic masses. He thought it probable that the tissues of plants
were included, since these also have life and soul, but nothing else.
Millerd too (Emped. 40f.) saw no evidence that the principle was
generalized, and used this as an argument against those who, like
Gomperz, have claimed for Empedocles that he anticipated the modern
chemical principle of proportional combination,                             She herself would
confine it to the actual examples mentioned (bone, blood, flesh, sinew),
and held that the phrase used by Aristotle—<em>/ogos of the mixture’—
has given to modern interpreters a false impression of universality.
Bignone on the other hand maintained that fir. 23</em> and 71 (which he
said are to be connected) at once extend the principle to the whole
animal and vegetable world, and in fact the “harmonious mixture’ of
fr. 23 implicitly affirms its universality.
Much depends on the meaning of the word karmonia. When used as
<p>a proper name it is the divine power also called Philia, Aphrodite and
¥ i whebveoss Panzerbeter for the etve nhtow iot of Simplichus.

as if blood ieself were a form of flesh, as indeed it must have been since the same formula applies
10 both. The Greek word céef, which from Homer onwards was used regularly in the plural,
covered a wider field than our <em>flesh’. (Cf. the eontent of the Hippocratic De carnibus.) Presum-
ably however blocd contained a larger proportion of water than did flesh. Perhaps Empedocles
intended 1o allow for this with his </em>about equal” and “a little more or a little less’. These phrases
at feast confess that the dacrrine of strict proportion as constituting the essensial hstincuon
berween specific organic subatances was refaxed to take account of observed differences within
what was regarded as a single kind. The same may have been dane for bone: cf. the distinction
drawn in De carn. between the compasition of salid and porous boaes (vi, §88 L.). (Bignone,
Ermped. 469 1., suggested that the language of approximation was used 1o allow for the presence
 of Love as well as the elements. Although Love was certainly present, I do not think this 3 likely
 way of alluding 10 the fact.)

Cyptis, which is the cause of a// mixture. She it is who joins zhings
together (ouvappdzet, of Aphrodite in fr.71. 4), and in this case it would
seem that neither the noun nor the verb can be confined to the special
sense of ‘combine in fixed proportion’. As a common noun, on the
other hand, at least for the Pythagoreans with whom Empedocles had
strong affinities, it connotes combination in mathematical ratio (vol. 1,
220, 223), and that is how Bignone regarded it in the simile of the
mixing of paints in fr. 23.4: ‘mixing them in Aarmonia, more of these
and less of those”.   Indeed his whole belief in the universality of the
principle depends on this. Yet what painter ever obtained his desired
shade by conforming to a recipe which laid down a numerical propor-
tion between the pigments, like a dispenser making up a‘medical
prescription? The thought is rather of the harmonious, that is pleasing,
effect produced than of the means of its production.
Aristotle, it is said, provides evidence that Empedocles did not apply
<p>propartion universally, for he censures him on this account as in-
consistent.   In the Metaphysics he sums up his review of the early
thinkers by saying that they were all groping after the four aspects of
causation in which he himself believed, but could not state them clearly
at a time when philosophy was still in its lisping infancy.
So Empedocles (he continues (993 a17)] says bone exists by the logos; that
is, the essence and substance of the thing. But it was equally necessary that
flesh and everything else should be the logos, or else none of them. That will
be the cause of flesh and bone and everything else—not the matter that he
alleges, fire and earth and water and air. If anyone else had said so, he would
have had to agree, but he has not put it clearly.
 This is a criticism on grounds of inadequate and obscure expression.
<p>Empedocles, it would seem, stated the ratio of mixture of the elements
of a few organic substances like bone, and emphasized that it was this
ratio that imparted their specific character to them; but in the case of
most other substances he was content to name their elements alone,
although if the point had been put to him, he would have had to agree
that their specific character depended also on the proportions in which
these elements occurred. This is obvious, since otherwise it would have
been impossible to produce the manifold variety of nature from four
elements only.

<p>                            Thke Logos of the Mixture
Elsewhere Aristotle seems to say that Empedocles’s theory demands
<p>a rationally proportionate mixture in every compound substance (De
an. 409b32):
It is the same with any other compound at all. Each of them consists of the
elements not in any haphazard state, but in a certain Jogos and mode of
composition, as for instance Empedocles says of bone. . ..
So also Simplicius introduces fr. 96 by saying (Phys. 300.19): ‘He
makes flesh and bone and o/l the rest by a certain logos.”
In the absence of the philosopher’s own words, any interpretarion
<p>of this evidence must be hazardous. It seems most likely however that
Empedocles believed all natural substances, metals and minerals as well
as organic tissues, to be differentiated from one another by a different
proportion of the four common elements in their mixture.                               He gave
only a few examples of this?all from the highest and most important
stratum of existence, namely animal life, and was upbraided by Aristotle
for neglecting to extend these explanations further; but his Pythagorean
faith in the kinship of all nature makes it improbable that he regarded
inanimate objects as composed on an entirely different basis from
animate. The difference would be one of degree, and would amount to
this, that the lower anything was in the scala naturae the more unequal
would be the balance of the elements within it. This is suggested by the
fact that the highest manifestation of physical life, namely rational
thought, has for its organ the blood,3 in which the elements display the
nearest possible proportions to those in the divine Sphere, namely one
to one4 Love is the power which unites different elements with each
other. It has been shown earlier (p. 161) that the products of these
  ' Aristotle’s argument concerns those who say that perception is of like by like (as e.g.
Empedocles in fr. 109). This leads to the absurd conclusion that the percesving soul must contain
the subsrance of all dhe infinite aumber of things which it perceives. It is no use saying simply
that it cantatns the fouc elements out of which they are all composed, for how then could it be
aware of the objects as separate wholes? Their specific character depends not on the common
elements but on the logos in which in each separate case they are combined.

unions, in a world where Love is opposed by Strife, are chance effects,
and there is nothing in the evidence here considered to alter that con-
clusion. The precise description of the proportions constituting certain
selected organic tissues might give the impression that Love was
working alone to produce those particular blends, but there is no reason
to distinguish the principle underlying their structure from that which
brought about any other compound substances. To demonstrate that
Empedocles ‘says that the parts of animals also came into being by
chance’, Simplicius (Pkys. 331.5) quotes among other exarpples the
first line of fr. 98 describing the composition of blood itself. Yet at the
same time he can say (300.25) apropos the composition ofjbone in
fr. 96: *That is, it happens by divine causation, mostly by Love or
Harmonia, for it is by her cement that they are joined.” Aristotle saw
no answer to his question: ‘Is Love the cause of any chance mixture,
or of mixture according to logos?’ The answer is that it is only from
his own teleological viewpoint that there is any essential difference
between chance and logos. The latter word, with its double significance
of ‘proportion” and ‘formal-final cause’, is his own importation.</p>

             (2) Medicine and physiology: reproduction
<p>The Sicilian school of medicine took its place alongside those of Cos,
Cnidus and Rhodes, and Empedocles was generally looked on as its
founder. Galen wrote:
In former days there was great rivalry between Cos and Cnidus as they
endeavoured to outdo each other in the number of their discoveries. These
were the ¢wo surviving branches of Asclepiads after the decline of Rhodes,
and they werejoined in that ‘noble wrangling’, which Hesiod eulogized, by the
physicians of Italy, Philistion, Empedocles, Pausanias and their colleagues.
There were then these three impressive groups of physicians competing with
each other. The Coan schaol was foctunate in having the most and the best
practitioners, but the Cnidian ran it close, and the Italian too was of no small
merit.</p>
<p>Philistion, an influential physician and writer on medicine in the fourth
century, was a native of Locri, but was also referred to as <em> the Sicilian’
from his connexion with the schaol. It was, says Pliny, known from
its reliance on observation as the empirical school,and began with Acron

of Acragas who owed his reputation to the fact that (like Pausanias)
he was a pupil of Empedocles.</p>
</em>
  In the surviving remains of Empedocles there is little information
about disease or its therapy; but we have not only his claim to impart
such information in frr. 111 and 112 (p. 132 above), but also evidence
of a consuming interest in the body and its functions. The influence of
his physiological theory is obvious in what we know of the theories of
later physicians like Philistion and Diocles, and of Plato himself. In
this respect the Timaeus owes an obvious debt to Empedocles, partly
at least through the medium of Philistion with whom in all probability
Plato was personally acquainted.?
The arrangement of the elements in organic bodies, which is the
<p>work of Love, is illustrated by examples of flesh-covered creatures and
those which have hard parts on the ouside. In the latter it differs, he
points out, from the order of the main masses in the world, which are
already largely the work of Strife and forecast the order that they will
assume when entirely separated.
(Fr.75) Those of them that are solid within and rare without, having got
this flaccidity in the hands of Cypris.
(Fr. 76) This you find in the heavy-backed shells of the sea-dwellers,
tritons and turtles of stony hide. There you will see earth [the heaviest ele-
ment] lying on the surface of the skin.
Empedocles        shows     especial interest in animal reproduction.                      He
<p>believed that the female as well as the male provides semen, different
parts of the offspring being formed from the semen of each (fr. 63,
Arist. G4, 722b10). The necessity for a correct mixture of the two
suggested to him an explanation of the sterility of mules, though we
have only Aristotle’s account of this,3 and he confesses to having found
it obscure. The reason as he gives it (G4, 747234) is that though the
semen of hoth horse and ass is soft, their mixture solidifies as the</p>

 ‘hollows’ of each fit into the dense parts of the other. This type of
 mixture, Empedocles says, makes soft bodies hard, as happens when
 copper is alloyed with tin. (Even this explanation of the hardness of
 bronze is wrong, remarks Aristotle.) The passage affords yet another
 instance of how he applied his general principles (in this case the
 doctrine of ‘symmetry of pores’, pp. 150f. abave) to &amp; particular case.
 Sex is determined by temperature, males being hotter than females.®
<p> So Aristotle (GA, 764 a1):                                                             :
 Others claim that the differentiation of sex takes place within thEe womb,?
 Thus Empedocles says that what enters a hot womb hecomes miale, what
 enters a cold womb female. The heat or coldness is determined byithe flow
of the menses, which may be either colder or hotter, older or more recent.
Again at 765 a8: ‘ We must also face the argument of Empedocles, who
differentiates male from female by the heat of the womb.” This applies
to the original formation of animals within the earth as well as to the
embryo in the womb. Of Empedocles himself we have the following
lines: (fr. 65) *And it was poured out in the purified paris;4 some
become women, when they have met with cold...” and (fr. 67.1)
“For in the warmer part of the earth appeared that which engendered
the male’.5

menstruation the offspring is male, if later fernale. But accarding to Galen (ad fr. 67) it was a
question of the right-hand s'de of the womb being warmer than the left, whereas the words of
Censorinus (5.4, DK, 481) would seem ta imply that sex depended on the semen coming frara
the right (male) or left (female) testicle. At least ‘ex dextris partibus profuso semine” does not
appear 10 refer to the receiving womb. (See also G. E. R. Lloyd in JHS, 1962, 6o, n. 19. He

In human beings the differentiation of the parts in the embryo begins
<p>from the thirty-sixth day and is complete from the forty-ninth, Male
embryos take shape more quickly than female, and the right-hand parts
than the left. The heart is the first organ to be formed, because it above
all contains the life of a man. The navel brings together four vessels,
two venous and two arterial, through which sanguineous and breathy
material is conveyed to nourish the embryos.                             These substances
according to Empedocles originate in the liver.?
He believed that menstruation occurs in women when the moon is
<p>waning, a superstitious idea with which Aristotle is rather surprisingly
inclined to agree, though more tentatively. Aristotle also gives a

Of the drawing of the infant’s first breath Aétius reports (4.22.1,

Empedocles says that the first breathing of the ffirst?] living creature is
[was?) caused! by the retreat of the moisture in the infants and the entering
  ¥ Agt. 5.10.¥ and 11.1 (A8x). The meaning of the clause about resemblances may be inferred
from the fuller statement of the Hippocratic De genitura 8 (Vi1 480 L.): semen is provided by the
bodies of both parents, and those parts of the offspring which contain more of the seed of one
parent will resemble the corresponding parts of that parent. But according to Empedocles tem-
perature was effective here toq, as well as in determining sex, if we may trust Censorinus.   (81,

</em> All these sratements depend on secondary sources, Aétius, Censorinus and Soranus. See
483, 84,79. On the question which organ was formed first, opinion in the fifth century differed
according to the view taken of what was the central and most vital organ, Thus Alemaeon (A13)
and Anaxagoras (A 108) said 1t was the brain. For Democritus see p. 467 below.

full moon (Wellmann, FG4, 1.197), whereas he himself took the sensible view that the fime of

<p>On respiration in general we have one of Empedocles’s most picturesque
passages (fr. 100).        Modern interpretations of it differ, and the differ-
ences affect the rranslation itself. The following translation%is based on
that of N. B. Booth, and goes against the view generally accepted until
recently, though this had already been challenged by D.k]. Furley.”
Whatever interpretation is adopted, one must admit that Empedocles
does not seem to have thoughr of all the problems raised by his
theory and that his poetical language is a1 some points irretrievably
vague.
This is the way that all creatures breathe in and out. All animals have tubes
of flesh, containing little blood, stretched our deep inside the body.* At their
mouths the furthest ends of the nostrils3 are pierced through with close-set
holes, so that the blood is kept out but a free pathway for air is opened
through the passages. Then whenever the delicate blood runs away from
here, the blustering air rushes in with furious surge, but when it leaps back,
the animal breathes out. It is as when a girl plays with a water-lifter (clepsy-
drd) of shining bionze> When she puts the opening of the neck against her
fair hand, and dips the vessel into the yielding mass of bright water, no liquid
enters, but the bulk of air falling from within on the close-set holes prevents
it until she uncovers the compressed stream of air. Then as the air gives way,
the water duly enters. Similarly when water occupies the interior of the
bronze vessel and the opening or passage is stopped by human flesh, the air</p>

outside trying to get in keeps back the liquid, commanding the surface®
about the gates of the gurgling strainer, until she releases her hand. Then,
the opposite of what happened before, the air rushes in and the water
duly rushes out. So with breathing, when the blood coursing through
the bhody leaps back to the inner recesses, straightway a stream of air
comes surging in, but when it returns, an equal quantity goes back and
is breathed out.</p>
The essential and agreed point of this account is that the rhythm of
<p>breathing depends on an oscillatory movement of the blood. On the
translation given here, there are tubes containing a little bload? coming
from within the body and ending at the hack of the nostrils. Here the
inner surface of the nostrils is pierced with holes so tiny that they are
impenetrable to blood but not to air. As blood pulses forward and
fills the tubes, the air is driven (breathed) out through these holes,
while the blood itself can go no further than the tiny perforations.
‘When the blood retires, air is drawn in again through the same perfora~
tions.
The clepsydra described here was a device for lifting liquid from one
<p>vessel (say a large jar of wine) and releasing it into another (say one of
the broad flat drinking-cups in use in Greece).3 It would be especially
useful when the liquid was low in its receptacle. Its nature and working
are thus described by Simplicius (De caelo, 524; cf. Phys. 647.26). It
is ‘a narrow-necked vessel having a broader base pierced with small
holes, now called Aydrarpax (<em></em> water-snatcher”)’. In language which
might be a prose paraphrase of Empedocles, he goes on to explain that
when it is let down into water with the upper orifice closed, the water
does not enter through the holes because the air collected within exerts
pressure against it and prevents it from coming up, having itself no-
where else to go. When the obstruction is removed from the opening at
the top, the water enters and the air gives place to it. If the upper
opening is again covered when the clepsydra is full of water, the water

cannot run out through the holes at the bottom because that would
cause a vacuum in the vessel, since air cannot enter to replace it either
through the closed mouth or through the bottom where the water
stops up the holes.!
 Two operations are described in the simile. Each deals with the
<p>effect of unstopping the previously stopped opening in the top of the
clepsydra, and inspiration and expiration respectively are compared
with these effects. In the first, the stopped clepsydra contains no water,
but uncovering the upper hole allows water to entér through the
strainer at the bottom as the air escapes through the top. | In respiration,
the inspired air corresponds to the water, and the blood: to the air that
retreats and makes way for it. Secondly, the girl starts                         by holding up
the clepsydra with water in it and her finger over the top, so that there
is no downward pressure of air on the water and it stays where it is
because of the upward pressure on the small holes in the bottom. She
takes her finger off and the water runs out. This illustrates expiration;
the air entering and forcing the water out corresponds to the blood
rushing up the tube, and the water to the air which is expelled
through the nostrils. In the body the blood is of course halted at
the mouth of the tube by the fineness of the perforation, whereas in
the clepsydra the air will follow the water through the holes, but the
simile is quite close enough to illustrate the process as Empedocles
imagined it.        We may agree with Booth                  that there is no great im-
probability in his having made air in the simile correspond to the
blood, and the air that is breathed out correspond to the water in
the simile.
According to earlier interpretations the theory expounded is that we
<p>breathe through the skin all over our bodies.?                       It is unfortunate that
the relevant noun could mean either ‘nostrils’ or ‘skin’, though the
  ' The interpretations of Burnet and Millerd are vitiated by their assumption that the clepsydra
in question is the water-clock which has a superficiel resemblance to it and borrowed its name.

A full description of its working occurs in [Arist.] Prodl. 914b9ff., where it is said that Anaxa-
goras also offered an explanation of the phenomena involved. There is no evidence to show
whether he was interested 1 the problem for its own sake or, like Empedocles, was using the
clepsydra as an analogy.

latter would imply an unusual and poetic use of the plural.                              Intro-
ducing the quotation Aristotle says (De resp. 473b1):
He says that inspiration and expiration take place because there are veins?
containing some blood, but not filled with it, and these veins have passages
leading to the outer air, smaller than badily particles, but larger than those
of air. Now it is in the nature of blood to move up and down, and so when
it sinks down the air flows in——which is inspiration—and as it rises up the
air is forced out in expiration. [There follows the quotation.]
In criticism of this Aristotle says (473a17):
He speaks of breathing through the nostrils (uuktdpewy) and thinks he is
referring to the essential process of breathing, whereas there is also
breathing from the chest through the windpipe, and without it there is™o
breathing, through the nostrils. Moreover animals can be deprived of breath-
ing through the nostrils without coming to harm, but if they cannot breathe
through the windpipe they die.
Evidently Aristotle saw nothing in Empedocles about breathing all
over the skin. In view of this passage, the words ‘to the outer air’ in
the previous one cannot mean the external surface of the skin all over
the body, but must indicate the inner surface of the nostrils, which is
equally in contact with the air. Similarly, A&amp;tius (4.22.1, DK, a74)
speaks of the blood as travelling to the surface (els v Emgdveiav)
and driving out the air through the nostrils.3
A strong point in favour of the established interpretation is that a
<p>theory of breathing through pores in the skin is expounded by Plato
in the Timaeus (79¢), who probably took it from Philistion the physician
of the Sicilian school.4 In general the influence of Empedocles on the
 Timaeus is marked, and moreover the principle behind Plato’s theory
of the ‘circular thrust’ is the Empedoclean one that there is no such
thing as empty space. On the interpretation followed here, it must be
admitted that Empedocles does not seem to have allowed for this

explicitly.r 1t would not be astonishing, however, if this difficulty had
not occurred to him and Philistion or Plato had rectified the omission
by a more sophisticated theory. No doubt the last word has not been
said, but to quote Booth again:
1f both Plato and Philistion believed that breathing occurred thiough pores
in the skin, this is admittedly an argument in favour of Diels’s interpretation
of pvédv as skin. But it is not nearly so strong as the arguments against:
Aristotle’s evidence, the improbability of pwév meaning anything other
than ‘nostrils’ in an account of breathing, the still greater impr'pbability of
Empedocles having made no mention of the nose in an account of| breathing.?
 Two claims are often made for this fragment which are inkidental o
<p>its physiological subject. First it is said that in it Empedocﬁes proves
the corporeal nature of air, as djstinct from empty space or rarefied
mist (aer). So for instance Burnet (£GP, 229):
Aristotle laughs at thase who try to show there is no empty space by shutting
up air in water-clocks and torturing wineskins. They only prove, he says,
that air is a thing. That, however, is exactly what Empedocles intended to
prove, and it was one of the most important discoveries in the history of
science.</p>
</p>
<p>This of course was not his main purpose here, nor could he well have
written as he did if he believed that preparatory to his explanation of
breathing he must prove as a startling new fact that air was a thing, The
clepsydra was in common use, and everyone must have known that the
invisible air could resist pressure and keep away another body.                                 Nor
does Burnet do justice to the point which Aristotle is making in the
passage he refers to (Phys. 213225). Those who play with inflated
* “If Empedacles did not heheve in a void. . . chea lie must have supposed diat something was
<p>displaced by the blood deep inside the body; this would presumably be air, which w culd then
have to go somewhere’ (Booth, JHS, 1960, 14). On the theory of Philistion see also Cardini,
Joc. ciz. 261—4.
* Booth 15 arguing aganst the view of D. J. Furley, which deserves mention in conclusion.
<p>Even though Empedocles believed, says Mr Furley, that we breathe all over our bodies, he must
have known that we also breathe through the nose and mouth; and he suggests that difficulties of
interpretation are avoided 1f we assume that the tap vent of the clepsydra corresponds o nose (ac
nose and mouth) and che strainer at the battom (o the pores in the skin. We hreathe in through
the nose as we Lreathe out through the pores, and vice versa, a process made possible by the
oscillation of the blood. The attraction of this explanation les in the neac way that it allots a
fanenon 1o both of the characiensiic fearures of the clepsydra, but as Booth has shown, it is not
without difficulues, and since the whole principle of the clepsydra depends on the upper opening
as well as the perforated bottom, the former is by no means otiose on the other explanations.</p>

<p>              Significance of the Clepsydra ‘ Experiment’
wineskins and clepsydras think, says Aristotle, that they have sufficiently
refuted the philosophers who hold that true void exists. All they do is
to prove that air is a thing (one is tempted to supply ‘and everybody
knows that”), whereas, he goes on, ‘ what is needed is not a proof that
aiv is a thing, but that there is not an interval distinct from bodies. . .
which breaks the continuity of the whole body, or even outside the
whole body, which remains continuous. That is what Democritus and
Leucippus and many other scientists maintain.” To demonstrate that air
is a thing is obviously inadequate as a refutation of this position.! The
denial of void was something that Empedocles accepted from Parme-
nides on the Parmenidean grounds that empty space is ‘what is not’.2
Anaximenes a century earlier already regarded invisible air3 as a cor-
poreal substance. The novel contribution of Empedocles is that as the
first philosopher with a pluralistic doctrine he was the first to regard
air as a pure element incapable of transmutation into any other; but
this he has said in different connexions and it has nothing to do with
the observations on the clepsydra.
The second claim made for this passage is that it is a striking instance
<p>of experimental method in the early days of Greek science. Some have
even given it on this account a scientific importance above anything
else that Empedocles said or did. Both claims are combined, for example,
by Benjamin Farrington in the statement that ‘his great contribution to
knowledge was his experimental demonstration of the corporeality of
the viewless air.. . . Empedocles undertook an experimental investiga-
tion of the air we breathe’, and by W. P. D. Wightman who writes:
‘By actual experiments with closed vessels under water he had shown
the existence of a distinct, corporeal substance (ci8np) different from
the misty, ill-defined &amp;#p of Anaximenes.”¢                     Others have denied the
status of experiment to what Empedocles describes.$ It is certainly not
what is understood as experiment by a modern scientist. The quotation
does not even suggest that Empedocles had performed the operation
  <em> Cf Simpl. Phys. 647.30. In the Pneumatica of Hero of Alexandria (pracem, vol. 1, 4-6
Schmidr) the corporealicy of air 1s demonstrated, in the same way as by Empedocles, in the course
of an argument designed to prove that vacua do exist, dispersed between the particles of bodies

himself. The clepsydra was not only a familiar utensil; its properties
made it a plaything for children, whom he had seen amusing themselves
with it. What he gives is a simile, an acute inference from observation
of an everyday occurrence; and as Cornford remarked, ‘1o draw a
clear-sighted inference from familiar experience is not the same thing
as to practise the experimental method as it is understoad today’.                          Such
explanation of natural phenomena by means of illuminating comparisons
with the practical arts was a favourite device of Empedocles. We have
seen how the elements are mingled like the colours on an artistls palette,
the action of heat on wet substance to make living creatures, suggests
the skill of baker or potter, and the hardening of male and fernale semen
is like the mixture of two soft metals in an alloy. The water whith issues
in hot springs, he thinks, must be heated within the earth by a system
of cailed channels like the coiled pipes of a water-heater which ensure
that the water passes through the same fire often enough to heat it, and
so, after going in cold, flows out hot (Seneca, Nat. gu. 3.24.1, 468).
The clepsydra ‘experiment’ is in line with these analogies.</p>

                                (4) Sleep and death
<p>Aétius (5.24.2, A85) records that in Empedocles’s view sleep resulted
from a cooling of the blood to the appropriate extent; death ensued
when the heat left it completely. In another statement, partly ohscured
by corruption,® he says that according to this view death is common to
body and soul (psyche). This is consistent with the function of the
blood as centre of the cognitive faculties (fr. 105), and is perfectly
credible if we remember (@) that psyche is the doxographer’s word and
unlikely to have been used by Empedocles, (4) that it refers to the
capacity for physical life, and for the cognition, through the senses and
reasoning powers, of the world around us. This is something different

<li>Aurelianus (Morb. chron. 1.5, A98), attributes to him the origin of the
belief that madness ( furor, Greek mania) is of two sorts. One is a con-
sequence of ‘purification of the soul’ (ex animi purgamento),3 the other
 of ‘mental alienation due to physical causes, namely imhalance of
 mixture’. Mania to the Greeks was by no means necessatily an evil:
 it might be a sign of divine possession, as in the Dionysiac mania of
 the maenads or the behaviour of the Pythia when prophesying. Plato
 in the Phaedrus (244a) speaks of ‘the greatest of blessings coming to
 men by mania’, and of this good menia he distinguishes three recog-
 nized kinds: that of prophets, healers and poets. All three were
 exemplified in Empedocles himself, a condition which he attributed to
 the high degree of purification that his soul had attained. (Cf. fr. 146,
 pp- 250 f.below.) All men have inherited a load of impurity—they are
 “ distraught with grievous wickedness’ (fr. 145)—but by following the
 precepts of the Purifications they can shake it off and reach the exalted
 state which culminates in apotheosis.
  Pathological madness, on the other hand, is caused by an ‘unbalanced
 mixture’, which must be that of the elements in the blood. Blood is

 about the soul and its immortality will be discussed more fully in connexion with the Puri-
 ficasions.

the organ of thought (fr. 105), and this is expanded by Theophrasts
thus (De sensu, yo—11, A86):
Men think mainly with the blood, for there the elements of the body are
most thoroughly’ mingled. Those then in whom the mixture is equal or
nearly so, with the elements neither too far apart nor t00 small nor too large,
are wisest and keenest of perception, and so, in proportion, are those who
come nearest to them; whereas those in the opposite state are most witless.
There is a faint foreshadowing here of the remarkable assurznce with
which Plato in the Timaeus (86b1L.) assigns somatic causes to psycho-
logical disturbances, including those which lead 1o imemp?rate and
criminal behaviour.</p>

              M.   COGNITION,           THOUGHT,          SENSATION
<p>On this topic more information is available about Empedocles than
about most other Presocratics, mainly because Theophrastus in his
critical-historical treatise on the senses gives more space to him
than to any other except Democritus.* He says moreover (§2) that
Empedocles himself, in defending his view of sensation as due to
the action of similars, went into more detail than others about the
working of each separate sense.</p>
                       (1) Al cognition is of like by like
Men think with the blood, and sensation also is a purely physical
<p>process. That is why Aristotle says that for Empedocles and other early
thinkers ‘sensation and thought were the same’.                      He means that ‘they
all assume thoughr to be corporeal like sensation, and that like is both
perceived and thought of by like”, This point he illustrates by two lines
of Empedocles: ‘Man’s wit is increased with reference to what is
present’, and (in a fuller and more accurate version in the Meza-
  ¢ Qr “most equably’. For A. Frenkian's correction of the MS. 4o (expunged by DX folfow-
ing Mullach) into los, see Philologus, 1963, 313.
* Theophrastus's work on the senses is generally reproduced (as in the present work) only in
<p>scartered sentences in the writings of histogians of Greek philosophy or psychology. For the
work as a whole readers may be referred to G. M. Stratton, Theophrastus and the Greek Physio-
logical Psycholagy before Aristorle, which provides a complete text, translation and notes.

physics) Asmuch as men change their nature, so much it also befalls them
to think different thoughts<em>.</em> In fr. 10§ Empedocles says of the heart that
itis ‘nurtured in the sea of pulsing blood, where especially is what men
call thought: for the blood around the heart is thought’.2 Theophrastus
gives another relevant quotation (fr. 107), putting it in its context as
follows (De sensu, 10). After describing the working of the senses
he continues: ‘Pleasure is induced by what is similar in respect to
its parts and their mixture, and pain by the opposite. He speaks in
the same way of knowledge and ignorance: knowledge is by similars,
ignorance by dissimilars, thought being the same as sensation or very
like it.”
Both sensation and thought, then, are special instances of the uni-
<p>versal principle that like acts on like. This is unequivocally stated of
sensation in frr. 109 and 107:3
With earth we see earth, with water water, with air the divine air, but with
fire destructive fire, with Love Love and with Strife we see dismal Strife;; for
out of these are all things formed and fitted together, and with these they
think and feel pleasure and pain.
The crudity of this general theory offended Aristotle. We may
<p>admit, he says (De an. 409b23), that the soul is composed of the
elements and therefore can recognize and perceive them; but how is it
to distinguish between their myriad compounds and know what is god
or man or flesh or bone, things whose distinctive essence consists in
the different proportions in which the elements are mixed? If like s
known by like, must we say that the soul contains not only the elements
but stones ot men?
Apart from the fact that at this stage in the history of science a satis-
<p>factory account of the physiological basis of sensation is hardly 10 be
expected, the faults of Empedocles’s theory are largely due to his heroic
attempt to explain all details in the pamiral world by reference to his
  T Arist, De an. 427222, Meraph. 1009b18; Empedocles fir. 106, 108. In the Metaph. Aristotle

apparenty synonymously. The author of the Hippocratic De corde says that the mind (yucun)
resides in the Jeft ventnicle, which rules the rest of the sout (ix, 88 Ligtré).

basic cosmological principles. This economy of explanation is strikingly
illustrated by what he says in fr. 110:
1f thou shouldst plant these things in thy firm understanding and contemplate
them with good will and unclouded attention,® they will stand by thee for
ever every one, and thou shalt gain many other things from them; for these
same things grow into every personality, according to the namire of each
man. But if thou shouldst hanker after things of a different sort, such as in
human life come in their thonsands, sorry matters that blunt men’s thoughts,
quickly will these things desert thee as time goes on, desiringito come to
their own kind; for know that all things have wisdom and 2 portion of
thought.                                                  4
The combination of physical and mental in these lines is fifficult to
<p>transfer to an alien language and age. Empedocles seems simply 10 be
telling his disciple to attend well 1o his teaching, but a more peculiarly
Empedoclean meaning is suggested first of all by the words ‘according
to the nature (physis) of each man’. They recall fr. 108: ‘As much as
men change their nature, so they think different thoughts’, which
Aristotle,     presumably        with    knowledge         of its context,         quoted      to
illustrate the point that thought is corporeal and affected by bodily
alterations. The physical implications are confirmed when we read that
‘these things’, if neglected for less worthy objects, will run away
because the desire to return to their own kind (like to like) will become
irresistible. If Pausanias holds fast to his master’s teaching, it goes
without saying that he will be acting in accordance with the good power
of Love; if he neglects it he is giving Strife, the evil power, its oppor-
tunity; and Love and Strife are at the same time the forces that unite
unlikes and likes respectively. As Strife grows stronger in the cosmos,
the elements dissolve their associations and each returns to its own.
Thoughr is blunted when the mixture of elements in the blood is
disturbed, and this is what will happen to the man who is seduced by
‘many sorry matters” from cultivating the power of Love in himself.
No wonder editors have been in doubt whether ‘these things’ refers
  * This gives the bare sense, but the echioes of terms used in the mysteries (xafapds, Eramreio,
weabm) have been remarked by several scholacs. See DK ad loc., Souilhé in Arch. de Philos.

  The text in Hippolytus has a number of corruptions, for which see DK,          but the sense is

</p>
                            (2)   Pores and effluences
<p>In more detail the action of like on like in sensation was explained by
applying the theory of the porosity of matter on which something has
already been said (pp. 150f. above).                    This is stated by Aristotle as
follows (GC, 324b25):
Some" believe that everything is acted on by the agent (that is the proximate
agent which is most properly so called) entering it through certain pores,
and this they claim is the explanation of sight and hearing and all our other
senses ; further that things are seen through transparent bodies like air and
water because such bodies have pores too small to be seen but arranged in
close-packed rows, and the more transparent a body s, the closer are the
pores. Some, of whom Empedocles was one, advanced this theory in respect
of certain bodies—not only those which act and are acted on, but they also
say that mixture takes place between bodies whose pores match each other
in size.
So also Theophrastus (De sensu, 7):
<p>Empedocles explains all the senses on the same lines, saying that sensation
takes place by a process of fitting into the pores of each organ. This is why
they cannot distinguish each other’s objects : some have pores too wide, others
100 narrow for the sense-object, so that some pass through without making
contact while others cannot enter at all.
What actually fit into the pores are films or effluences (&amp;moppoat)
<p>which physical objects are constantly giving off. They are mentioned
in one extant line of Empedocles (fr. 89: ‘Knowing that there are
effluences from all things that have come into being”) which Plutarch
expands by saying that there is a continual outflow from everything—
* Cf. Aét. 4.9.6 (DK, 28 4 47): * Parmenides, Empedacles, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Epicurus
<p>and Hecaclides say that particular sensatians take place according to symmetry of pores; the
proper abject of each sense fits into the sense-organ.’ The tendency to group philosophers to-
gether is charictenistic of the doxographers, and 1f Parmenides held this theory thete is no other
evidence for it.</p>

organisms, minerals, land and sea—and that this is what finally causes
their decay (p. 15t abave). Plato (Meno, 76¢) brings in this general
theory with reference to vision, in which connexion itis most frequently
cited:
You agree with Empedocles that there are certain effluences from existing
things?
    Certainly,
    And pores to which and through which the efluences make their way?
    Yes.                                                                             i
 Some of the efffuences fit into some of the pores, whereas others are too
<p>fine or too coarse?
 That is so.
    ... Colour then is an effluence from shapes commensurate with sight and
<p>perceptible by it.
    An example of how the theory works outside the field of sensation
<p>is provided by the curious explanation of magnetism, of which we have
the following account:<em>
On the reason why the lodestone attracts iron. Empedocles says that the
iron is attracted to the stone by the effluences which issue from both, and
because the pares of the stone are commensurate with the effiuences from
the iron, The eflluences from the stone stir and disperse the air lying upon
and obstructing the pores of the iron and when this s removed the iron is
drawn on by a concerted outflow.                   As the effluences from the iron travel
towards the pores of the stone, because they are commensurate with them
and fit into them the iron itself follows and moves together with them.
The Greek commentator sees a number of objections to this, based
<p>on the universality of the doctrine of pores and effluences. Why should
not the magnet follow its own effluences and be drawn towards the
iron instead of vice versa? Why do not other bodies bave the same effect
on iron? Why indeed are not quite different pairs of bodies similarly
affected, seeing thar Empedocles mentions many othecs as having com-

tus.     With   this   explanation of magnetism   should   be compared   pp.   372,   426   below.   The
attractive power of the lodestone was known to the Greeks from the time of Thales if nat before,
and in Roman times at least its repelling power also, though they had no understanding of the
principle of polarity. They made no practical use of it (e.g. they did not, like the Chinese, invent
the compass), nor did they make artificial magnets. For a brief statement of their knowledge of
magnetism, see Cohen and Drabkin, Source Book, 310, and for a fuller account Rommel m RE,

<p>             Some Degree of Percepuion in Everything
mensurate pores and effluences? Here he quotes fr. 91 (p. 151 above).
The universal application of the doctrine is also seen by Theophrastus
as a difficulty in applying it to sensation.
How [he asks (De sensu, 12)] will living creatures differ as regards sensation
from everything else? Sensible objects fit into the pores of inanimate things
as well, for he explains all mixture by symmetry of pores. That is why oil
and water do not mix (fr. 91), in contrast to other liquids and all the sub-
stances whose particular capacities to mingle he enumerates. Thus every-
thing will be capable of sensation, and mixture, sensation and growth will
be the same thing ; for he explains everything by symmetry of pores, unless
he posits some distinctive cause in addition.</p>
<p>The same applies to thought (§23): everything will share in it, for its
causes are the same as those of sensation.
  In this case, however, the attack misfires, for it was in fact funda-
mental to Empedocles’s whole system that there is no distinetion
between animate and inanimate and everything has some degree of
awareness and power of discrimination. Fr. 103, ‘Thus then by the
will of Fortune all things think’, is not conclusive proof of this, any
more than fr. 102, ‘ Thus then everything has breath and smell’, means
that everything in the world breathes and smells. It is however un-
ambiguously stated at the end of fr. 110 (p. 230), and demonstrates
once again how the general forces governing the universe are never
forgotten by Empedocles       when he comes       to work    out its details.
Nothing that was withour feeling could be subject to the action of Love
and Hatred, and these are the sole activating forces, acting alike on the
elements, inorganic compounds, plants, animals and men. This is not
to say that there is no distinction between the workings of the human
mind and the cognitive powers of an oyster. Aristotle’s bald statement
that for Empedocles     ‘sensation and thought are the same’ is only
intended to bring home the truth that both result from equally corporeal
causes. There is a clearly defined hierarchy in nature, but it is a matter
of degree only: no radically new process is involved at any stage. In all
this Empedocles was partly moved by the religious considerations which
find expression in the Purifications, namely the possibility of trans-
migration from one form of existence to another, and the struggle to grad-
uate from lower to higher forms. To Theophrastus the idea that fire or

stone should have some measure of cognition was ridiculous, as it was to
Aristotle, who noted that parts even of an animal’s body, such as bones,
sinews and hair, seem wholly insensitive.! They did not therefore think it
incumbent on them to waste time on the train of thought which had led
Empedocles ta his curious conclusion. More pertinent perhaps are the
questions which they raised concerning the physical apparatus of pores
and efluences.          This is criticized         by Aristotle, and more briefly                  and
trenchantly by Theophrastus,* who simply asks: are the pdres full or
empty? If empty, Empedocles is contradicting himself, singe he does
not believe in the existence of empty space; but if they are never empty,
but the pores, say, of an animal are always full of exrraneo\us matter
5o constituted as 1o it into them, the animal will have sensations 2}l the
time.
 These are questions which Empedocles would hardly have been
<p>prepared to answer, and there is little point in inventing answers for
him.3 He would not contravene his Parmenidean principle of the im-
possibility of void: there was a continuous flow of some sort of matter
through the pores, even if only of air as in his account of breathing;t
but this might not be sufficient to produce any strong sensation.</p>

                                         (3) Vision
<p>Early Greek theories of vision fall into three groups. According to one
the eye was the agent, sending out rays from its own ‘fire’ to the
object; according to another it received more or less passively ‘efflu-
ences’ or ‘images’ directed to it from the object; in the third, both eye
and object are active, the eye sending out rays which mingle with the
efffuences from the object. The Pythagoreans and their associates seem
to have emphasized the first aspect, the atomists the second, while the

bodies, the capabihty of yielding and leaving a narrow passage {or an entering body. When a body
pushes in, it fills the poros; where no body has yet peneirated, the poros exists only as a possibility,
This perhaps smacks rather of Acistotelian potennality, but 1t might be supported by the re-
flexion that from earliest times (e.g. Hom, IZ 2,592, 14.433) mépos meant a ford, and there is no
£ap in the water of the river until a body makes its way chrough.

combination        is represented         by Empedocles            and     Plato.     The   exact
nature of Empedocles’s theory is difficult to recover, and obscurities
must probably remain; but if we take his own fr. 84 in conjunction with
Theophrastus, and add the criticism of Aristotle, we must conclude that
he adopted some form of the third way. The evidence consists chiefly
of a long quotation from his own poem and the full, though not
always      lucid, description of Theophrastus.                          As with breathing,
Empedocles uses a simile from human invention to explain how the
eye sees (fr. 84):
As when a man, thinking to go out through the wintry night, makes ready
a light, a flame of blazing fire, putting round it a lantern to keep away all
manner of winds; it divides the blasts of the rushing winds, but the light, the
finer substance, passes through and shines on the threshold® with unyielding
beams ; so at that time? primeval fire, enclosed in membranes, gave birth? to
the round pupil in its delicate garmentsS which are pierced through with
wandrous channels. These keep out the water which surrounds the pupil,
but let through the fire, the finer part.
Simplicius tantalizingly quotes four separate lines which evidently
<p>have to do with the eye or vision, but only in passing, to illustrate
other topics, so that they tel! us little or nothing of Empedocles’s mind
on the subject. In his discussion of the role of chance in the generation
of parts of animals (Phys. 331.3), he gives fr. 85: ‘The gente flame
[of the eye] met with a very little earth.” At Cael. §29.21, speaking in
general of the works of mixture caused by Love, he says:
Again when he is speaking of the making of our bodily eyes he introduces
this line (fr. 86):
       ‘Out of which divine Aphrodite formed eyes’,

<p>Simplicius could so easily have given us the lines about some animals
seeing better by day and others by night (to which Empedocles seems
to have attached surprising importance),® but as he has ngt, we must
take this and the rest of the theory from Theophrastus, whzase account

He says that the interior of the eye is fire, and around it are earth and air
through which, being fine in texture, it penetrates like the light in lanterns.
The pores of fire and of water are arranged alternately. By those of fire we
perceive white objects and by those of water black,<em> for each class of objects
fits into each kind of pore.           Colours are brought to the eye by effluence.
Eyes are not all composed alike from the contrary elements,? and some have
the fire in the centre, others on the outside, This is the reason why some
animals have keener sight by day and others by night: those that contain
less fire, by day, for the light within them is compensated? by that without;
and those that contain less of the opposite element [i.e. watet], by night, for
then they in turn have their deficiency made up. In the reverse conditions
the contrary is true. EvenS those with a greater quantity of fire are dim-~
sighted by day, for then it is increased sull further and stops up and oceupies
the pores of water. The same thing happens by night to those in which water
preponderates. The disability persists until for the latter group the water is
intercepted by fire from outside,® and for the former the fire is intercepted

by vapour.       Each condition is cured by the contrary. The best and best
blended eye is one which is composed of equal amounts of fire and warer.
This is roughly what he says about vision.
Aristotle adds the information that the preponderance of fire or
<p>water may be learned from the colour of the eye (GA, 779b15):
It is wrong to suppose, as Empedocles does, that blue eyes are fiery whereas
black eyes have more water than fire, and that for this reason the blue do
not see well by day owing to lack of warer, and the others by night owing to
lack of fire.
As has often been noted, the prominence of fire and water in the
<p>operation of the eye suggests the influence of the Italian Alcmaeon, who
taught that the eyes contain fire and “see through the water surrounding
them’, Nevertheless for Empedocles they are made up of all four ele-
ments, as appears {rom {r. 85 which mentions earth, from Theophrastus,
and from fr. 109 (p. 229 above). It must also be remembered that
Alemaeon belonged to the opposite school of thought from Empedocles,
which explained sensation as the interaction of dissimilars (vol. 1, 3471).
According to Theophrastus, colours are carried to the sight through
<p>effluence from their objects, as in Plato’s Empedoclean definition.
Aristatle (De sensu, 437b23) accuses Empedocles of inconsistency in
that he sometimes explains vision by light issuing from the eye (as in
fr. 84, which he quotes) and sometimes by emanation travelling to the
eye from the object. It is very probable that Empedocles thought of
both factors as effective without working them into a coherent theory
as was done later by Plato (T7m. 45b—c, G7c~d).2
 Empedocles also tried to explain mirror-images, a phenomenon
<p>which (as Taylor remarked® in connexion with the disproportionate
attention given to it by Plawo in the Zimaeus) must have seemed
* This is what Professor W. J. Verdensus would call ‘a confession of impotence’. For his

simplest laws of optics. On this we have only an inadequate summary
in the Placira of Agtius (a88):
Concerning images in mirrors, Empedocles says that they are produced
through the effluences which collect on the surface of the mirror and are
condensed’ by the fire which is expelled from the mirror and carries with it
the air in front into which the streams are carried.                                '
In his general theory of vision, Plato followed Empedocles fairly
<p>closely, though if Aétius is to be trusted he departed from him in his
explanation of mirror-images by making no use of ‘air’.? {Nevertheless
the part played by the two “fires’, internal and external, ip his theory,
may throw some light on the account of Empedocles’s view ), Plato says:
As a resulr of the combination of the two fires, inside and outside,? and again
as a consequence of the formation, on each occasion, at the smooth surface,
of a single fire which is in various ways changed in form 3 ali such reflexions
necessarily occur, the fire belonging to the face [i.e. the face seen in the
mirror] coalescing, on the smooth and bright surface, with the fire belonging
to the visual ray.

a bell reproducing sounds in the same volume:* he calls it ‘a shoot of
flesh’, The air when it is stirred strikes against the solid parts and produces
asound.
Aét. 4.16.1 (A93): Hearing occurs in the impact of air on the cartilaginous
part, which he says is like a bell that hangs swinging within the ear and
is struck.</p>
It is difficult to construct a detailed physiological picture from these
<p>meagre     descriptions.       Beare     thought      that by cartilage          Empedocles
meant some structure which he had found by dissection, but more
probably he was relying less on observation than on a preconceived
notion of how the ear must work if hearing was to conform to his
general principle of sensation by physical contact.? In this case the
effluences are waves of air set in motion by whatever caused the sound
outside. (That every sensation is a matter of effluences fitting into pores
is stated by Theophrastus, De sensu, 7, 20.) They enter the ear and
reproduce the sound by striking a rescnant cartilaginous member., In
the naively materialistic view of Presocratic thought this sufficed for
explanation. Aristotle advanced to the distinction between the physical
argan, which was a sine gua non of sensation, and the act of sensation
itself which was a psychical event supervening on the physical affection
of the organ. Armed with this distinction his pupil Theophrastus
proceeds 10 criticism of Empedacles (De sensu, 21):
He explains hearing by sounds within the ear, but it is absurd to think that
be has made it clear how creatures hear by positing a noise inside, as of a
bell. We hear external sounds by this, but what makes us hear the bell
itself?   This is just what still remains 10 be asked.</p>
The theory of Empedocles resembles that of Alcmaeon in so far as
<p>air in the ear produces an echo of sounds outside, though the two
philosaphers differed on the basic principles of sensation and thought
(vol. 1, 347£).</p>
* If the MSS. are correct, the literal meaning is ‘a bell of the equal sounds’.   *Echoes that
<p>resemble the sounds outside’, Millerd, Others have suspected the text. See A. E. Taylor in

<p>By putting together two single-line quortations, a dubious couplet of
Empedocles on this topic has been recovered.                      It refers to a hunting-
dog, and most probably ran (fr. ro1):
Tracking down with his nostrils the particles from the bodies of wild beasts,
(the scent?) of their feet which they leave in the tender grass.t
 These     particles,    or fragments,          constitute    the    ‘effluences’      which
<p>Empedocles’s theory of sensation requires, as may be éathered from
the context in Plutarch’s De curiosiace.              !
 The     only    other     extant     fragment         on the subject i§        quoted     by
<p>Theophrastus (De sensu, 22) to emphasize that Empedocles insists on
breathing as the essential cause of smell, ‘even adding at the end as if
t0 set a seal on it (fr. 102): “In this way then all things have received a
share of breath and odours.”’
 Theophrastus’s own report (ibid. 9) is:
<p>Smelling is due to the act of breathing, for which reason those have the
keenest sense of smell in whom the movement of the breath is most vigorous,
and the strongest scent flows off from fine-textured and light bodies.
 There rernains only A8t 4.17.2 (A494):
<p>Empedocles says that scent enters together with the breathing that is
effected by the lungs. At any rate when the breathing becomes laboured,
its roughness prevents our             smelling as well, as in people         suffering     from
catarrh.
Presumably the last sentence corresponds to something that Empedocles
said, but if so, it deserved at least a mention when among his many
severe criticisms of the theory Theophrastus writes that hard breathing
is of no assistance to smelling ‘if the sense-organ is unhealthy or in
some way Obstructed’.

                              (6) Taste and Touch
<p>Theophrastus (De sensu, o) says that Empedocles gives no specific
account of the processes of either taste or touch, nothing in fact but
the general statement, applicable to all sensation, that it is a matter of
effluences fitting into pores. This may be true of the processes, but he
seems to have had an interest in the composition of flavoured substances.
According to Aristotle (De sensu, 441a4) he believed water to contain
every sort of flavoured particle in sizes and quantities too small for any
particular flavour to be perceived. This must be connected with 2
resnark of Aelian: ‘Empedocles of Acragas says that there is some sweet
water in the sea, not perceptible to all, but serving to nourish the fish;
and that the cause of this sweetness in the brine is a natural one.”<em> This
sounds like a deliberate contradiction of Heraclitus (fr. 61, vol. 1, 445),
who adduced the fact that sea-water was life-giving to fish but fatal to
man as proof of the identity of opposites. There is also the passage on
the flavours of wine and other vegetable products quoted on p. 208
abave.
 The statement that water could be withont perceptible flavour while
<p>containing within itself all flavours in quantities too small to be dis-
cerned shows how Empedocles prepared the way for Anaxagoras and
the atomists. For Anaxagoras, in the initial state of the world when
‘all things were together’, ‘none could be distinguished for their small-
ness’;? and the whole atomic theory depended on the existence of
particles below the level of sensation.
As 10 touch, 1 heophrastus is especially critical of the omission of an
<p>explanation, because of the difficulty of reconciling it with the general
theory of effluences. In a way, of course, Empedocles has reduced all
sensation 10 touch, that is, to a matter of physical contact (&amp;mreabar)
though not of the specific sense of touch (&amp;gn). This was an inevitable
consequence of the materialism of early theories of sensation, and was
made more explicit by Democritus.3

                               (7) Pleasure and pain
<p>The sensations of pleasure and pain are mentioned in fr. 107 (p. 229
above), and Theophrastus reports (De sensw, 9) that pleasure is excited
when the sense-organs encounter objects similar to themin their partsand
in the mixture of the elements in their composition, and pain when the
objects are dissimilar. More succintly in §16 he says that Empedocles
explains pleasure by similars, pain by dissimilars, and quotes in this
connexion vv. 6 and 7 of fr. 22 (p. 158 above): ‘But enemids are those
that are furthest from each other in origin, composition and moulded
form.
 There are also two relevant statements in Agtius:
<p>4.9.15 (495): Empedocles says that pleasure occurs by the action of likes
on likes, and in the making up of what is lacking, so that desire is the reach-
ing after kindred substance in what lacks it. Pain is caused by contraries, for
all things that differ in their composition and in the blend of the elements
are hostle.
So also 5.28 (493):
<p>Desire in animals corresponds to their lack of the elements which constitute
each one.®</p>
</p>
</p>
Thus pleasure and pain are spoken of, as Theophrastus says (§16),
<p>purely in terms of physical sensation. In his account Empedocles
differs from Anaxagoras, who, we are told, held the curious theory that
all sensation is accompanied by pain (Theophr. §§ 17, 29, p. 318 below).</p>
                                     (8) Conclusion
<p>For the explanation of the individual senses, Empedocles’s own words
are in most cases lost. Where we have them, in the case of sight, the
account is in highly poetical terms and takes the form of a simile, so
that   translation       and    interpretation        are    controversial.         It must       be
remembered therefore that the sources on whom we rely for the other
senses were probably faced by similar difficulties. The figurative lan-
guage of fr. 84 is reduced by Theophrastus to the simple statement that
* Tomit the rest in the text as being corrupt. See nate in Dox 440. The rescoration in DK may
<p>be translated : pleasure arises from what is proper to the mixnire of kindred and similar substances,
and distress and {pains from the contrary)’.</p>

fire passes out through the other elements in the eye ‘like the light in
lanterns’. It is at least passible that when he speaks of a part of the ear
as being ‘like a bell’, he is similarly condensing a number of lines over
which the moderns would differ no less if they had the text before them.
It is unwise therefore to place too much reliance.on the details of the
doxographic reports or build elaborate physiological theories on such
foundations.
The essential point is that for Empedocles all cognition, thought as
<p>well as sensatjon, {s in some way reducible to the interaction of physical
bodies. We obtain knowledge of the world in which we live because
it and we are composed of the same elements, and where those
elements are blended in similar proportions, consciousness and
awareness are the result. Thus knowledge depends on physical
condition, which aflects our relations with the external world
(frr. 106, 108). This seems to be a rationalization of an idea already
expressed more obscurely in early poetry.® Moreover, everything
in the natural world, including animals and men, is only a temporary
combination of the elements brought about in the course of a struggle
between two forces, one seeking to unite and the other to separate
them. Here lies the chief difficulty in reconciling the physical poem
with the Purifications, which       introduces      us to an immortal part of
living creatures capable of surviving the dissolution of a seties of
bodies and finally emerging as divine.
Another fundamental consequence of the physical explanation of
<p>cognition is the disappearance of any sharp line of cleavage between
animate and inanimate. All things have a share (though not an equal
share) of consciousness. In this way a physical account is given of
the belief in the kinship of all existence which runs through
Empedocles’s religious as well as his scientific thinking.
Of the limited powers of sensation and thought as means of appre-
<p>hending reality something has already been said (pp. 138 f. above).

                               (x) Introduction
<p>The title of this work, in Greek Katharmoi, signifies means of purifica-
tion, either by lustration, libation, sacrifice and other forms of ritual,
or by obedience to certain precepts of restraint. Such purification was
necessary when, whether wittingly or unwittingly, a man had made
himself unclean by offending against some divine ordingnce, The
canses of this miasma or mysos might range from homicide to'accidental
trespass in a sacred grove. When Creon announces that the,plague at
Thebes is caused by a miasma which Apollo has bid them get rid of,
Oedipus asks: ‘By what katharmos?’ (O.T. 99). When as an old, blind
man Oedipus has wandered into the grove of the Eumenides at Colonus,
the Athenian elders tell him he must make a kazharmos. The required
procedure varied, but naturally, being essentially a cleansing, it often
involved water, as in this instance, where the first thing Oedipus has
to do is to draw water from an ever-flowing spring. In the Seven
against Thebes (738) it is asked, When once the ground has drunk the
dark blood of slanghter, who can provide a katharmos, who can wash
it away?     In Sophocles again (O.T. 1227{.) the messenger says that
neither of the two great rivers Istros and Phasis can ‘wash with
katharmos® the stain from the house. An example of this type of
katharmos is found in the poem of Empedocles himself. Theo Smyr-
nacus, comparing progressin Plato’s philosophy to the stages of initiation
in the mysteries, says that the first stage is katharmos, which
corresponds to education from childhood upwardsin the right subjects:
and just as Empedocles says one must cleanse oneself ‘by drawing
water from five springs in unyielding bronze’,<em> so for Plato this educa-
tion consists of five subjects.
Empedocles was not the only one to apply the term to a written
<p>work. In the Republic (364¢) Plato speaks contemptuously of begging
priests and prophets who claim to have the power to absolve from
guilt through sacrifices and incantations. Quoting the authority of
books attributed to Musacus and Orpheus, they persuade individuals
' Fr. 143. The readings in DX should be compared with those of Hiller’s text of Theo
<p>Smymnaeus (13.7-11).

and cities that there are means of release and karharmoi to be accom-
plished through sacrifices and ‘childish amusements’. In the form of
telerai, these rites can secure immunity from punishment after death.
Empedocles also is in the Orphic ambience, and it is possible that some
of the books mentioned were entitled Katharmoi. In the Frogs of
Aristophanes (v. 1033) we read that Orpheus taught selerai and absten-
tion from killing, Musaeus healing and oracles, and Hesiod the Jore of
farming. The mention of Hesiod puts them in a literary context, and
a scholiast on the passage says thar Musaeus ‘composed katharmoi’.
Similarly the Suda says of Epimenides that he </p>
</p>
</p>
</em> wroce certain mysteries
and katharmoi’.
  Practical precepts in the extant fragments of the Katharmoi of
Empedocles include, besides the rite of purification by water, absten-
tion from meat and beans and from laying hands on the bay: according
to Hippolytus they also included sexual continence.” The rest of the
poem puts these precepts in their cosmic setting and explains their
necessity, by telling of the fate of the souls of all living creatures. They
are immortal daimones whose home is with the blessed, but who have
been seduced by Strife into sin and are now exiled by an inexorable
decree and condemned to be tossed in torment from one element to
another of the sublunary world. Only by strict adherence to the rules
of purity, and by gaining an understanding of the divine nature, will
they escape from the round of incarnation in separate animal bodies and
regain the company of the gods. This is the tale which we have now to
reconstruct in as much detail as the surviving information will allow.
Love and Strife continue to play their part in it as they did in the
description of the world of nature and its processes, but here of course
the emphasis is on the moral rather than the physical effects of unifica-
tion and division. Strife brought about our falling away from a former
state of divine unity, and to restore it is to co-operate with Cypris,
who reigned in the age before murder, perjury and other causes of
division were known.

 This is a good example of the lofty arrogance which formed one
<p>facet of the many-sided character of its author. Though paradoxical,
it is not at alf unnatural thac such a passionately religious soul should
at one moment reflect on his immense superiority to the common man,
and thinking of his imminent release and apotheosis speak as if they
were already achieved, and at another bemoan the sin and the cruel fate
which has dragged him down to this earth ‘a fugitive and a wanderer
from the gods’ (fr. r15.13). His language here recalls (not accidentally,
we may be sure) the words in which the guardians of the other world
address a nameless initiate after his death: <em> Happy and blessed one, thou
shalt be god instead of mortal.’® The same arrogance and claims to

<p>                            Empedocles’s Lofty Arrogance
supernatural powers appear in his promises to Pausanias in the poem
on nature (fr. 111):
Thou shalt learn all drugs that exist to ward off ills and old age, since for thee
alone will I accomplish all this. And thou shalt stay the power of the un-
wearied winds which sweep upon the earth and lay waste the fields with their
blasts, and, if thou wish, bring back their breath again. After dark rain thou
shalt cause a seasonable drought for men, and after summer’s drought bring
on the streams that nourish the trees as they pour [? word dubious] from the
sky. Thou shalt bring back from Hades the sirength of a man who has died.
 Most prominent among the gifts that Empedocles has to offer are
<p>healing and prophecy, and from fr. 146 we learn that prophers and
physicians are among those who have won through to their Jast
incarnation and are ready to join the gods.
His conscious superiority puts him above the human struggle, and he
<p>continues (fr. 113): ‘But why am [ hot against these men, as if it were
some great thing for me to surpass mortals doomed to destruction?”
This reminds us of the statement of Aristotle that he was indifferent
<p>to office, and of Timaeus that his political life was in contrast to the
egotism of his writings.<em>
In speaking of divine matters his tone is different from that appro-
<p>priate to an investigator of nature relying on the partial powers of
hurman sensation and reason (fr. 2, pp. 138 f. above). Then he asked
the Muse to vouchsafe only ‘what is lawful for creatures of a day to
hear’ (fr. 3). Now his prayer is this (fr. 131): ‘If, immortal Muse, for
the sake of a creature of a day it pleased thee to consider my endeavour,
attend once more to my prayer, Calliope, as I make plain a good dis-
course about the blessed gods.”3                     He knows that what he now says is

Here again, in the sphere of knowledge and its attainment, we meet
the combination of pride and humility which was noteworthy also in
Heraclitus (vol. 1, 414). Pride in possession of certain truth is the mark
of the seer who believes himself divinely inspired ; consciousness of the
fallibility and inadequacy of the human faculties belongs rather to the
scientific mind. What we are witnessing in these men (in Empedocles
far more fully than in Heradlitus) is the gradual transformation of the
seer into the philosopher. That is what makes the essentjal unity of
their thought so difficult to comprehend, while at the same time it lends
them an absorbing interest. Part of Empedocles’s knowledge, he
knows, is derived from ordinary everyday experience, buri part of it
from his privileged access to a world of gods or spirits."
                         (3)    The Golden Age of Love
<p>The idea of a bygene age in which men and women of perfect moral
character lived, as in the Garden of Eden, under perfect natural condi-
tions was much older than Empedocles and may have come to the
Greeks from Oriental sources.<em>                In Greek literature it first appears in
Hesiod: the epithet ‘golden’ (not used by Empedocles so far as we
know) applied to the goodness of the men, and except for their
mortality they lived like gods; pain was unknown, death came like
sleep, and earth bore her fruits without human toil.
This ancient and widespread                  belief Empedocles         wove     into his
<p>cosmogony as the age of Love. It was not of course the cosmic reign
of Love, when the elements were fused in the one divine Sphere and
no human beings existed; but since throughout our present era Love
has been losing and Swife gaining in power, it is obvious thar when
men were first formed Love was a stronger force. This may be called
the reign of Love in the human sphere, and it is thus described (fr. 128):
Among them was no war-god Ares worshipped, nor the battle-cry, nor was
Zeus their king nor Kronos nor Poseidon, but Cypris was queen. Her they
propitiated with pious offerings, painted figures and variously                      scented
unguents, sacrifices of unmixed myrrh and fragrant incense, and they poured

The age of simplicity and happiness was traditionally the age of
<p>Kronos, ‘Saturnia regna’. Servius says that according to some theo-
gonies, including the Orphic, an age of Poscidon followed thar of
Zeus.*&gt; For Empedocles the ruler of the age of blessedness is none of
these, but Aphrodite.            Nature as well as man was under her dominant
influence, and so, as in other golden ages (fr. 130), ‘all things were tame
and kindly to man, and lovingkindness was kindled abroad’. Trees
bore leaves and fruit ip abundance all the year round, in a climate that
was like a perpetual spring, as in the mythical gardens of Alcinous.3</p>

The solemn terms in which Empedocles pronounced the law against
this have been preserved by Aristotle (Rhet. 13730 6), quoting fr. 135:
...as Empedocles says ahout not takiag life.                    It is not, he says, right for

“Bur this, the Jaw for all, extends unendingly through the wide-ruling air

bring the impious food to my lips!”                       Here we are on Pythagorean
ground, and, as we should expect, the basis of the law is the doctrine
of transmigration. So fr. £36: ‘Will ye not cease from ill-sounding
slaughter? See ye not that ye are devouring one another in theheedless-
ness of your mind?’ and with greater vividness fr. 137:
The father lifts up his own son changed in form, and slaughters him with a
prayer in his great folly. Others look on beseeching as he sacrifices;<em> but he,
deaf to their protestations, slays him and makes ready in his halls an evil
feast. Even so son seizes father and children mother, and tearing      qut the life
they feed on kindred flesh.
The sacrificial animal may be one’s own dead relation, ‘chinged in
form’. Empedocles also included in his poem the Pythagorean injunc-
tion to abstain from beans, in a line (fr. 141) which was also attributed
to the Orphic writings. This itself was due to a curious belief in an
affinity between beans and human life. (See vol. 1, 184£.).
 The notion of transmigration is pursued in other quotations,in which
<p>it is made plain that the soul may live in plants no less than animals.
Of himself Empedocles says (fr. 117): ‘Before this have I been a boy
and a girl, a bush and a bird and a dumb fish of the sea.’
There is a hierarchy of lives, men being a higher form than animals,
<p>animals than plants. Within these main kinds the gradations persist.
‘Empedocles too says’, writes Aelian, ‘ that the best move is into a man,
but if his lot transfer him to a beast, then a lion, or if to a plant, a bay.’
Empedocles’s words are these (fr. x27): ‘Among heasts they become
lions with their lairs on the mountains, their beds on the ground, and
bays among the leafy trees.’
Within mankind the distinction persists, and those souls that have
<p>won their way to the threshold of apotheosis are incarnated in the
highest forms of humanity (frr. 146-7):
At the end they become prophets, bards, physicians, and princes among men
on earth. Thence they arise as gods highest in honour, sharing hearth and
table with the other immortals, free from human sorrows, unwearied.</p>

<p>physician, and was offered the highest place in the state. His apotheosis
is immediate and assured. That is the justification for his winumphant
cry to his fellow-citizens: ‘I an immortal god, no longer a mortal.”
Another fragment on transmigration has a special interest in that it
<p>refers to a particular             man,     who      is, beyond         all reasonable          doubt,

                                  (5) The fallen spirits
<p>The impressive fr. 115 introduces the doctrines that have appeared in
other quotations—bloodshed as the cardinal sin, the cycle of reincarna-
tion—but develops the idea that the souls which go the round of
mortal bodies are in themselves divine spirits: the divinity to which
they ultimately attain is a return to their original and proper state. Their
fall is related thus:
There is an oracle of Necessity, an ancient decree of the gods, eternal, sealed
with broad oaths:<em> when any errs and pollutes his own limbs with the blood
of slaughter, or following Strife (?) swears a false oathS—the spirits whose
portion is length of life—they must wander for thrice ten thousand seasons®

difficulty for the identification of the subject with Pythagoras. (Cf. Minar, Phronesis, 1963, 149,
n. 2.) Rostagni (V. di P. 229£.) takes it as meaning ‘among early prophets’. Even if it refers
o the time when Cypris was queen, is it npat possible that the numerous incarnations of
Pythagoras    might    reach back into the age of Love?      For some of his previous incarnations

away from the blessed ones, being born through time in all manner of forms
of mortal creatures which tread in rurn the troublous paths of life, The mighty
heavens pursue them to the sea, the sea spews them out on to the floor of the
earth, earth to the rays of the shining sun, and he casts them into the circling
heavens.” One teceives them from another and all abhor them. Of these 1
00 am now one, an exile from the gods and a wanderer, having pur my trust
in raving Strife.                                                                      '
The notion of gods undergoing a fixed period of exile from heaven
<p>for wrongdoing, and specifically for perjury, is taken by Edhpedocles
from Hesiod’s Theogony, lines 793-804. The most binding oath that
the gods can swear is by the waters of Styx, says Hesiod, and cbntinues:
Whoever of the gods who dwell on the summuts of snowy Olympus pours
out this water in swearing falsely, he lies a full year without breath, Nor
does he touch the nourishment of ambrosia and nectar, but he lies breathless
and voiceless on a strewn couch, enveloped in cruel torpor. When this sick~
ness is over, at the end of a great year, one trial after another, each more
difficult, awaits him. Nine years is he kept from the ever-living gods, for
nine whole years laaving no share in thew councils or their banquets; but in
the tenth he rejoins the assembly of the immortals who dwell in Olympus.
These are the popular gods of IHomeric belief. To this traditional
<p>material Empedocles has added the Pythagorean doctrine of trans-
migration of souls and the cycle of births,* In this connexion an
illuminating comparison is with a passage of Pindar, a contemporary
of Empedocles who visited Sicily. Plato quotes it in the Meno 10
illustrate the doctrine that the human soul is immortal and undergoes
many births.
Those from whom           Persephone receives requital for ancient doom, in the
ninth year she restores again their souls to the sun above. From them arise
noble kings, and the swift in strength, and greatest in wisdom; and for the
rest of time they are called heroes and sanctified by men.3</p>

</p>
<p>3000 years, In any case the paraliel with Hesiod, T4, 799, suggests ¢hat Empedocles had a *Great
Year” in mind (see vol. 1, 282), as also does Plato, Politieus z71d—e, where the time taken for
souls to complete their oned pumber of births comcides with a world-cycle. On \he other
hand those may be nght who think that 1piopiprcu here, as often elsewhere, stands only for an
indefinitely large number. (So Zeller, Robde, and Millerd, Emped. 5, . 3.)

<p>                          The Doctrine of Reincarnation
  Here again the soul (psycke in Pindar) is being punished for an
ancient wrong,! and when men have purged it they become *sanctified
heroes’ after a final incarnation in the highest forms of humanity, as
kings or men          of outstanding physical            or mental       gifts.     In Plato’s
Phaedrus the cycle from each birth to the next takes 1000 years, and
normally? ten of these must be completed before a fallen soul can regain
the society of the gods which it enjoyed before its fall (though not
itselfa god; in Plato’s version the gods are flawless and do nor fall).
  It looks as if these accounts have a common basis, so that the ‘ninth
year’ of Pindar corresponds to the goooth of Plato, and also of Em-
pedocles if we may assume that his ‘seasons’ represent a third of a
year. There existed a systematic body of religious doctrine, commonly
and with good reason known as Orphic, which was current especially
in Western Greece, and by individual writers of genius could be
modified to suit their own purposes. The word daimon in . 5, trans-
lated “spirit” because that makes it easier to comprehend as something
incarnated in mortal bodies, could                    without confusion be rendered
‘god’4       Of these Empedocles says that he himself is one, an ‘exile
from the gods’.5          In frr. 146-7 he describes the purified souls in their
last incarnation as the highest forms of humanity, ‘whence they arise
as gods, highest in honour, sharing hearth and table with the other
immortals’. Just so the exiled gods in Hesiod return to the banquers
of the immortal gods.            Empedocles has been called, usually with some
disparagement, an eclectic.              It is obvious that he has made use of a
variety of existing heliefs, but the achievement of constructing his own
grand system is scarcely lessened thereby. Every religious and philo-
sophic writer, however individual a genius, is eclectic if the word is</p>

 his own cosmology is seen here in the dramatic description of the guilty
 spirit’s stormy journey through the four elements, and their indignant
 rejection of it (it must be remembered that ‘the elements too are
 gods’, p. 143 above), and in the mention of Strife as the evil influence.
 Empedocles dwells in moving terms on the horrors of this world
<p> and the woes of the soul when it has been ‘clothed in an alien garment’
 of flesh’ by Necessity? (fr. 126). He speaks out of the anguish of per-
 sonal experience. ‘I wept and wailed when 1 saw the un%ccustomed
 place’ (fr. 118). And again (fr. 124):
‘O alack, O wretched race af mortals, O sore unblest; o‘pt of such
<p>contentions and groanings were ye born.” Andinan 1solate&amp; fragment
of a sentence (fr. 119): ‘From what high rank and what a height of
bliss. ...’ This world to which we have come is a ‘roofed-in cave’, a
‘joyless place’ where ‘Murder and Anger and tribes of other spirits of
 death, and parching diseases and wastings and the works of flux wander
in darkness over the meadow of Doom’.3

Aristotle. (See LS] and p. 408, n. 1 below.) Possibly Empedocles even has in mind his own
description of the ongin of men and women from the <em>whole-natured forms® that arose out of
the earth. We have noted resemblances berween these and the bubbles of Jife which others de-
seribed as growing out of a sort of fermeatanion on the earth’s surface (p. 2co above).    An account

There is also mention     of the agency of Ananke.       See the publication by R. Merkelbach in

be altogether exchided.)

<p>                             Strife and the ‘Opposites’
It is, as he has taught in the poem on nature, a world of mortal things
<p>that are born, decay and perish. For Empedocles, as for the earlier
natural philosophers, this is inseparable from its character as a world
of ‘opposites’, and in the language of the Purifications some of these
pairs are presented in personified-or demonic form (fir. x22 and 123):
Therewere the Earth-maiden and far-seeing Sun-maiden, bloody Discord and
grave Harmonia, Beauty and Ugliness, Haste and Tarrying, lovely Truth and
black-haired Obscurity, Growthand Decay, Repose and Waking, Motion and
Stability, Greatness with many crowns and Sordidness, Silence and Voice.
With these allegorical pairs of figures Empedocles expresses, in
<p>almost Heraclitean fashion, the co-existence of opposites physical,
moral and aesthetic, without which the natural world could not exist.
This world, as in the poem on nature, is clearly to a large extent under
the sway of Strife, and to this unsatisfactory realm the souls of men are
bound for ever if they will not listen to the prophetic voice of Empe-
docles and abjure Strife and all his works: “ Wherefore, distraught by
grievous wickedness, never will ye relieve your heart of wretchedness
and sorrow’ (fr. 145). It is possible that in the lost portions of his poems
Empedocles recounted a full theogony like Hesiod, <em> Orpheus’ and other
theologoi. In the poem on nature he mentioned ‘long-lived gods, highest
in honour’, along with trees, human beings, animals, birds and fish,
among the products of the four elements and Love and Strife (fr. 21.12),
and in introducing fr. 128 Porphyry says that it occurs ‘when he is
writing on the generation of the gods (8eoyovic) and on sacrifices’.
terrestial world tn the words </em>“We arrtved ia this roofed-in cave”.. ., We have strong evidence
elsewhere that the conception of the world as a cave is Orphic.” Jaeger is supporting Rohde
(Psyche, Eng. tr. 403, n. 75), with whom Bignone (Emp. 4931.), Kranz (Hermes, 1935, 114, u. 1),
Millerd (Emped. g3, n. 5) and Dodds (Gks, and Irrational, 174, n. 114) also agree. The Orphic
image of the cave, as everyone knows, was also applied to this life on earth by Plato, (See
Bignone, 493, for passages indicative of Orphic origin.) That the descripnion should recall the
uaderworld is only natural, for true to the Orphic tradition Empedocles regards the life of the soul
as belonging to a higher region, and banishment 1o carth as the equivalent of death. To the
 Orphics <em>the body is a tomb’ (Guthrie, Gks, and their Gods, 311, n. 3).
  </em> All the nouns are of feminime form, and some have epithets indicating their personification,
which nevertheless is extremely difficult to make plausible in transtation, save by the device,
adapted by some, of writing Lady this and Lady that. In composing the catalogue Empedacles
evidently had 1n mind the catalogue of Nercids in the Zfiad (18. 39 f1.), which besides names suit~
able for sea-nymphs has also some more abstract, including Nnueptis.        In general however the
lists are quite different, and the contrasting pairs are Empedacles’s own,

                            (6)    The way to salvation
<p>In general the soul must learn ‘to fast from evil’ (fr. 144), an isolated
and striking phrase quoted by Plutarch. 1t must lead a pure life,
practising the £atharmol recommended and above all abstaining from
flesh. There is also something else, the knowledge of the divine which
the pure soul may hope to attain (fr. 132): ‘Blessed is he who has
obtained the tiches of divine wisdom, and wretched he who has a dim
opinjon in his thought concerning the gods.’
Since like is known by like, to know the divine is to be dssimilated
<p>to it as in Pythagorean belief (vol. 1, 211). ‘ With earth welsee earth,
with water water.” If then we become clearly aware of the ‘nature of
divinity, there must be a divine element in ourselves. It is not to be
grasped by the bodily                organs     (fr. 133,      quoted by        Clement        of
Alexandria):
For the divine, says the poet of Acragas,
*1s not 1o be reached and made accessible by the eyes, nor grasped with
<p>the hands, though by this way the broadest path of persuasion enters the
heart of men.’
This is because (fr. 134):
Neither is the god furnished with a human head on a body, nor do two
branches spring from its back, it has no feet, no swiftly-moving knees, no
hairy genitals; but it is only a mind, holy and beyond description, darung
through the whole cosmos with swift thoughts.<em>
The criticism of anthropomarphism recalls that of Xenophanes,
<p>whose god was ‘in no way like mortals either in body or mind’, but
‘sees, perceives and hears as a whole’ and ‘remains in the same place,
not moving        at all, but without          toil makes      all things shiver by          the

</em> The fr. is thus mtroduced by Ammonjus      (see DK): ‘ Wherefore the sage of Acragas also,
having censured the myths of the poets which represent the gods as having human shape, ex-
pressed himself thus, principalily about Apollo, of whom he had just been speaking, but simitarly
i his general explanavon of divinity as a whole: ““ Nerther 1s it fumished ”, etc.”
  D.L. (8. 57) sad that Empedocles composed a proemium to Apollo which was burned.         Apart
fror that and a doubtful reference in Genethlius (a 23, of. Wilamowitz, SBB, 1929, 644), this is
the only mention of the name in cannexian with Empedocles. It does not occur in any fragment,
It is therefore impossible to be certain how he used ir, but since Apollo was the patron deity of
the Pythagoreans it js not unlikely that he applied it to his own non-anthropomorphic highest
divinity. Bignone (Enmped. 642) supposed it 1o have been an alternanve name for the sun.
  It 15 very possible that frr. 133 and 134 form a single quotation, as DK suggest.</p>

impulse of his mind’.<em> More important, it is obviously meant to recall
the description of the divine Sphere of the elements united under Love
(fr. 29). Two whole lines are identical in both, or practically so; then
for the last line, ‘bur it was a Sphere, and in all directions equal to
itself’, is substituted ‘but it is only a holy mind’, etc. This raises the
whole question of Empedocles’s theclogy, on which something must
be said before we can consider the ultimate destiny of the fallen gods
in mortal bodies.
                                    (7)    The gods
<p>The evidence for Empedocles’s theological beliefs is not of course con-
fined to the Purifications, but may be conveniently considered together
in a chapter dealing with the religious aspect of his thought. The mind
of a mystic on this subject does not lend itself to logical analysis,? and
we are further hampered by the fragmentary state of the poems.
Certainty on all points is therefore unattainable, but it is well to remem-
ber at the outset that ‘god” is by no means an exact equivalent of the
Greek theos.      G. M. A. Grube, repeating the acute remark of Wilamo-
witz that theos is primarily a predicative notion (not ‘God is love” but
‘Love is a theos”), remarks that ‘any power, any force that we see in
the world, which is not born with us and will continue after we are
gone, could thus be called a god, and most of them were’3
Our reading of the poems has shown that Empedocles recognized at
<p>least the following categories of gods:
(1) The four elements.
(2) Love (Aphrodite, Cypris) and Strife.
(3) Certain products of the elements. In fr. 21 it is said that from
<p>them grow trees, men, women, beasts, birds, fish, ‘and long-lived gods
highest in honour’, and the same list is repeated in the simile of paints

</em> In strict logic one might for instance ask: if incarnation is for the daimones a punishment for
perjury and bloodshed, and if the souls of men are incarnate daimones, how is it that there was a

expression,

chary of speaking, as same scholars have dare, of ‘the God of Empedocles’, and then trying to
identfy this one god.

on a palette, fr. 23.8. This allows for the gods of popular belief, and
since Greek mythology contained stories of gods being born (e.g.
Apollo and Artemis, Hermes, Dionysus and Zeus himself) and dying
(like Dionysus and the Cretan Zeus) it is not surprising to find that,
though long-lived, they are subject to ultimate dissolution.®
(4) The Sphere in which the four elements are perfectly blended with
<p>Love (p. 168 above).
(5) The holy Mind of fr. 134.
(6) The daimones or spirits who for their sins are caughf in mortal
<p>bodies, but if they learn 1o live in purity will finally arise again as ‘gods
highest in honour’ (the same phrase as that used of the Iong—]‘ived gods
formed from the elements in fir. 21 and 23).                                     \
Empedocles also speaks, like any other Greek poet, of gods in the
<p>plural without further specification. In fr. 131 he prays to the Muse as
he ‘sets forth a good discourse (or tale) about the gods’, and in 132 he
speaks of those who have only a dim opinion about the gods. This is
a Greek way of speaking which does not exclude the possibility that he
had a peculiar theology of his own. Xenophanes, that staunch upholder
of the unity of God, conld also speak of ‘being unmindful of the gods’
when the context was appropriate (fr. 1.24). That the world was
peopled with divine spirits was a universal belief which Empedocles
no doubt took for granted. A Greek could multiply such spirits with
the greatest of ease, as he does himselfin frr. 1253, and it by no means
follows that all had to be given a fundamental position in his physical
and theological system. Kranz may even have been right in comparing
the traditional gods in Empedocles, the products of the four divine
‘roots’, to those of Epicurus: he did not deny their existence, but
assigned no influence to them.
What must be taken seriously, for their cosmic or human significance,
<p>are the Sphere of Love, the boly Mind, and the daimones, and their
relations with each other. The identical wording of the lines describing
in negative terms the non-anthropomorphic character of Sphere and
Mind had naturally led some to identify the two. This was done by
Diés, Souilhé and Jaeger. An obvious difficulty is that the Sphere
exists only at a certain stage of the cycle, and that during its perfection

there is no cosmos in the ordinary sense. ‘Darting through the whole
cosmos’ would be a strange description of it. To this Diés replied that
the globe retains its divinity and power of thought in its disintegrated
state. Each particle is, ‘more or less confusedly’, divine and thinking
(fr. 110.10), retaining as it were a memory of the original felicisy of
the Sphere, Something similar must have been in Jaeger’s mind when
he identified the Sphere with the holy and unutterable Mind, and on
another page wrote that ‘this highest God is essentially akin to the
single world-controlling intellectual God of Xenophanes, except in the
fact that it never remains fully realized in this world’.t
  Although these views are comprehensible, it is a little confusing to
identify with the perfect Sphere of Love the divine element in a state
of things when the perfect Sphere no longer exists as such.                             Bignone
thought it best to identify the holy Mind of fr. 134 with Love or
Aphrodite. He drew attention (Emped. 643) to the phrasing of fr. 17:
it is by Love that men think kindly thoughes, and she is circling or
whirling (8Miocopévnyv) among the elements, as the Mind darts through
the cosmos.       Reiche combines the two views when he says (Mixture,
etc. 36) that the words ‘holy and unutterable mind’ refer ‘not only to
the force of Love, but to the Sphairos in particular’, and he concludes
(p. 38):
While Anaxagaras’s Nous is wholly outside the corporeal plenum-mechanism,
Empedocles’s ‘holy and unutterable mind’, being itself Sphairomorphic
mixture, is only in part (i.e. qua Love) outside that mechanism. In addition,
it permeates it in the form of the demons within plants, beasts, and men, and
so keeps the ‘mechanism’ in mytion from within.<em>
The tendency to impose a kind of monotheism on Empedocles, to
<p>seek as Diés did for ‘Le Dieu d’Empédocle’, goes back to Hippolytus,
whom Digs in fact quotes in this connexion, interpreting in this way
the Christian bishop’s comment on the line (fr. 115.13) in which
Empedocles calls himself an exile from the divine: ‘That is, he gives

before being torn away by Strife and born among these many creatures
of the world which Strife ordered’ (Ref. 7.29, quoted by DK ad loc.).
To interpret the adytum cordis of a man like this is impossible, at least
on our insufficient evidence, and it must be admitted that the fragments
tell nothing of the relationship of the divine Mind to Love or to the
Sphere. The resemblances between fr. 134 and fr. 29 suggest at least
that the Mind is a strong force for unity, and one would suppose that
Love represents its working in so far as it enters the cosmos,                          Where it is
opposed by the evil and disruptive force of Strife. That the Mind is the
highest form of divinity we need not doubt, especially considering its
affinity with the one god of Xenophanes. We may also say that although
there is as yet no formal distinction between material and spiritual,
Empedocles has brought it a step nearer by the language of fr. 133. The
divine is at least invisible and intangjble.
 Anything further is conjectural. It may be that some help is to be
<p>found in another comment of Hippolytus, overlaid though it is with
later terminology and ideas. He writes:
Empedocles says thar there is the cosmos ordered by Strife, the evil one, and
another, intelligible cosmos ordered by Love. These are the two contrasting
principles of good and evil. Between the contrasting principles is the just
Logos, in accordance with which the things which were sundered by Strife
are joined together and brought into harmony with the One by way of Love.
This same just Logos which works on the side of Love he addresses as the
Muse, and calls to be his helper.
The idea of an ‘intelligible world” is a Platonic importation, although
once the Platonic distinction between sensible and intelligible worlds
was established, the assimilation of Empedocles’s system to it was
pardonable, considering that he too spoke of divinity as something
that cannot be seen or touched. The expression ‘just Logos® comes
from Stoicism, like ‘right Logos’ in Sextus, when he says in connexion
with fr. 2 that according 10 some interpreters the criterion of truth in

Empedocles is not the senses but the ‘right Logos’.                              But here also, as
Bignone says, it is reasonable to suppose that the context of these
fragments contained some dactrine which made possible an interpreta-

later thought to what that doctrine may have been, the dikaios logos, the
Hellenic spirit of just proportion, which we know from the fragments to
have played an essential part in the harmonia of Empedocles’s world,
seems to stand outside this cosmos in which Love acts as its agent-—or
rather, is the Logos in so far as it penetrates the physical cosmos. What
later writers <all the Zogos in Empedocles may therefore be what he
named the holy Mind, the divine element as was the * Logos existing for

we suppose Empedacles to have had always at the back of his mind the
contemporary religio-philosophic world-picture, which I have sug-
gested* would be instinetively retained by even an original thinker of
the fifth century, just as even an original pre-Copernican in the Middle
Ages would assume that the sun went round the earth, According to
this picture, the cosmic sphere, with its conflicting elements and perish-

and Strite as &pyai to the former! The only other hint of tt1s1n Simplicius (Phys. 1124.4), where
after interpreting the Sphere of Love in Neaplatonic terms as the intelligible world, and that
dominated by Strife as che sensible, he adds thac one may see both unity and divisiun 1 this
world too: “the first in the sky, which might plausibly be called a sphere and god, and the second
in the region below the moon’. If we could suppose (as many do) that in the present world of
Strife’s dominance Love’s influence is strongest in the outer spaces and she 15 abandoning the
centre to her opponent, this would provide a neat correspondence berween physical and religious
doctrine, But at present,as Lhave said{pp. 183 f.above), I think a correct reading of fr. 35 forbids
it. (DK omit these passages of Hippolytus and Simplicius, perhaps wisely.)

dilution in the process. For the mystic, small portions of it are imprisoned
in the bodies of men and animals, and even of plants. According to
a widespread belief it was the ‘divine aither’ (Aesch. P.V. 88), into
which the immortal mind of a man plunged at death (Eur. He/. 1014).
   Another quotation from Euripides reflects his reading of the philo-
sophers and comes closer to Empedocles’s own ideas:* ‘All things
return, the products of earth to earth, but those that have sprung from
actherial seed go back 1o the vault of heaven. Nothing dies that is
born, but separated one from another they reveal a differentiform.’ In
this striking passage Euripides echoes the words of Empedqcles fr. 8,
that there is no such thing as death, but only separation of wha\; has been
unified, and shows how easily such an apparently physical doctrine could
be combined with a religious belief in fallen spirits and their ultimate
reunion with the divine nature. The doctrine of ‘like to like’ and the
combination of earthly and heavenly in mortal creatures could take their
place together in a rational scheme of the natural world, ver recur in the
Orphic myth of the origin of the human race from the earth-born Titans
who had devoured Dionysus and were reduced 10 ashes by the thunder-
bolt of Zeus; and another parallel to the lines of Euripides is found in the
mystic’s boast inscribed on a gold tablet from a South Italian tomb:
‘Tam a son of Earth and starry Heaven, yet is my lineage of Heaven.”
   Empedocles did not give the popular name aitker to divinity in its
uncontaminated state. This word, which in earlier and contemporary
literature had been somewhat loosely and ambiguously used? he
appropriated for one of his four ‘roots’, air in its elemental purity. This
divinity was something different from the four elements, non-sensible,

to be apprehended only by the responsive element of divinity in our-
selves. It was probably (though to affirm this goes slightly beyond the
evidence) the element of intra-cosmic Love or goodness, ‘ whereby men
think kindly thoughts and do peaceful works’. By separating divinity
fram the four elements Empedocles may have assisted the emergence
of the ‘fifth element’, which when we meet it fully developed in Aristotle
is divine, the substance of the stars which are gods. Possibly, however,
although he did not advance to the idea of purely incorporeal being,
he was nearer to it than some of his successors when he refused to
identify it with any of the ‘roots’ but called it ‘only a holy and in-
expressible mind’.
   1t may seem strange, perhaps indefensible, to believe in a divine
Mind and in our own true selves as incarnated, individualized fragments
of it, and at the same time to explain the physical universe by causes
which interact in a purely fortuitous way. Yet it was of the essence
of early Greek mysticism to hold, not that the divine was respansible for
the ordering of matter as it is, but that the whole cosmic order was
the enemy of divinity. We think in terms of Platonism and Christianity,
bur it was a conscious protest against the prevailing view when Socrates
and Plato argued that if there is a divine Mind, then it must have
ordered the world for the best.

                    (8)    The nature and destiny of the * soul’*
The Greek word psyche, which is usually transtated ‘soul’, occurs only
once in the fragments of Empedocles, in the sense of *life’. To take life
is to draw off the psyche (fr. 138). Itis improbable that he used it either
for the combined faculties of sensation and thought, which depend on
the blood and other bodily organs, or for the divine spark in us which
is alien to the body and which he called daimon. By using the word
‘soul” to cover both of these, earlier interpreters puzzled themselves or
accused Empedocles of blatant inconsistency in saying in the poem on
nature that the soul died with the body, and in the Purifications thatit was
an immortal spirit. That particular difficulty should no longer trouble
us. The faculties whereby we live in the body and have cognizance
  T With this acconnt should be compared that of Kahn, *Religion and Natural Philosophy in

of the physical objects around us consist of various blends of the same
elements as these physical objects—necessarily so, for like is per-
ceived by like. That in us by which we are capable of having know-~
ledge and understanding (as opposed to ‘dark opinions’) of the divine
is quite different, since by the same rule it must itself be divine. The
Hesiodic lore of the spirits of heroes becoming ‘good daimones’ after
their death had already been developed and altered by Orphic and
Pythagorean doctrine, but Empedocles probably stiil had 1t in mind,
and he (or his Orphic sources) had combined it with the sto;y of gods
exiled from heaven for their sins. In Hesiod the men of the Golden
Race after their death became ‘good daimones through the will of great
Zeus, dwelling on earth, guardians of mortal men, who warch over
righteous and evil deeds, going up and down over the land clad in
darkness’ (£rga, 121-5). Empedocles may have thought also of the
spirits of men, between incarnations and before final apotheosis, as
performing a similar function, for Hippolytus says: ‘Empedocles
spoke much about the nature of daimones, saying that there are a
great many of them and they go up and down directing earthly
affairs.’? 1t should not be necessary to enlarge further on the fact
that the word ‘soul” has been commonly used to cover what in
ancient belief were two distinct entities, for this has been done earlier
in connexion with the Pythagoreans. (See vol.1,317-19.) The duality
was surprisingly persistent, for it appears even in Aristotle. His general
theory of psyche as the actuality of an organic body left no room for
belief in immortality, in which in his maturity he had little incerest. He
was no mystic, scoffed at the idea of transmigration, and had nothing
to say about rewards or punishments in a future life. Yet it still seemed
to him that there must be one human faculty, namely noxs or the power
of intuitive apprehension, which falls outside the general natuze of the
psyche. 1t *appears to be a generically different manifestation of soul,
which alone is capable of separation, as the eternal {rom the perishable’.
Nous alone ‘enters from outside and alone is divine’.

                        The Fate of the Daimon
    In Empedocles, what enters from outside, alien 10 the body in which
it finds itself, is the daimon. It is there as a punishment for following the
ways of Strife, and to earn its release it must rurn, Jike the blessed ones
ofan earlier age, to the worship and service of Apbrodite or Love.         Its
final reward is to be for ever rid of the body and restored to divine
status, Mare than that the fragments do not say, but the nature both of
his system and of similar religious statements of the time encourages a
guess: it achieves a inode of union with the source of all unity, harmony
and goodness, and with the divine Mind to which it proved its affinity
even on earth, by turning away from the elemental compounds and seek-
ing, like to like, the knowledge of what is not to be seen with the eyes
orgrasped with the hands. As the Orphic devotee suppressed the Titanic
and cherished the Dionysiac within him, so the follower of Empedocles
must abjure the works of Strife and cultivate the spirit of Cypris. Of
all this—Love, divine Mind, daimones—we have learned something in
the preceding pages. Time, the loss of the greater part of his poems,
and the unique character of Empedocles himself forbid us to hope for
certainty on all the ultimate beliefs which he drew ex adyto tamguam
cordis.   But not the least part of his fascination lies in the way that, as
we saw at the beginning and now know better, he typifies the complex-
icy of the Greek mind of his time. Some love the Greeks for their
rational achievement, their classical sense of form, proportion, sym-
metry and order. Others exalt the romantic, Dionysiac strain of
enthusiasmos in which reason abdicates and man feels the ecstatic joy
of possession by the god. We may be capable of responding to one side
only of this contrast, but if we would do justice to the Hellenic spirit
we must recognize that it included both; and we are helped to under-
stand this by the knowledge that they were combined not only in one
people bur in one man, Empedocles of Acragas.

                               ANAXAGORAS
With Anaxagoras we return from Western Greece to Ionia, both geo-
graphically and in spirit. Coming from Clazomenae near Smyrna, he
is described as a philosophical heir of Anaximenes,* and ceftainly the
spirit of the old Milesian school is revived in him.                  Uncomplicated by
the passionate religious feelings that moved Empedocles, hiy thought
returns to the lonian tradition of free inquiry, motivated byicuriosity
alone and governed by a purely scientific temperament. The change is
also marked, as we might expect, by a return to prose as the medium
of expression.       He deserves special notice as the man who                      brought
Tonian physical speculation to Athens at the height of her political and
intellectual development, for he spent thirty years of his life there and
was a close friend of Pericles.
                                    (1) Date and life
Anaxagoras son of Hegesibulus of Clazomenae was older, but only a
little older, than Empedocles. Which of the two produced his work first
is a matter of controversy, but the opinion may be hazarded that
Empedocles links up more directly with Parmenides, and that Anaxa-
goras wrote slightly later and possibly with knowledge of the poems of
Empedocles.? He was born, it would seem, about 500 B.C., and the
thirty years which he spent in Athens ended in his exile to Lampsacus,
where he died about 428 (the year of Plato’s birth, as Hippolytus
remarked) aged seventy-two. Hisbook was finished later than 467, the
year of the fall of the meteorite at Aegospotami (p. 302 below). So much
may be said with confidence, though the more detailed chronology of
his life is a matter of some dispute.3 Coming from a wealthy family,
  ! Late writers calt him, impossibly, a pupil of Anaximenes (DK, 47). Theur source will be che

he showed no interest in money but gave up his inheritance and the
political influence that it might have brought, to devote himself single-
mindedly to science and philosophy. This is mentioned by Plato, and
Aristotle comments more than once on his lack of interest in practical
matters, There wasalso a story currentin Aristotle’s time that whenasked
why tobeborn was better than not to be born (a form in which pessimism
about human life was often expressed by Greek poets), he replied that
a man would choose to be born ‘in order to study the heavens and the
whole universe’. Clearly there was factual foundation for the character
of typical unworldly philosopher which he assumes in later writers. It
was said that when he received at the same time the news of his own
condemnation and the death of his son (or sons), he commented on
the former, ‘ Both my judges and I were sentenced long ago by nature’,
and on the latter, ‘T knew that I had begotten them mortal’.! Again,
when he was reproached for his fack of interest in public affairs, as
implying neglect of his fatherland, he is said to have replied that he
did indeed care for his fatherland—pointing to the heavens.                               The
implication, that he belonged to the whole cosmos, was not in-
tended to indicate any sympathy with the religion of his time, to
which, at least in its more superstitious forms, he is consistently
represented as in opposition.            Plutarch tells that a countryman brought
to Pericles the head of a ram which had a single hom growing
from the middle of its forehead. The soothsayer Lampon interpreted
this as meaning that of the two rivals for supreme power, Pericles
and Thucydides, that one would prevail to whom the head had been
brought. Anaxagoras however had the skull split open and in a
brief anatomical lecture explained the natural reasons for the anomaly.
The people, says Plutarch, were full of admiration for his know-
ledge, but transferred           their admiration to Lampon                 when     a short
time afterwards Thucydides fell and Pericles took over sole control
of Athens.®
    In Plato’s Phaedrus (2702), Socrates is majntaining that all great
arts, including rhetoric, demand a study of nature, and says: ‘ This is

what Pericles acquired to supplement his natural gifts. In Anaxagoras
he found, I think, that kind of man, stored his mind with astronomical
Tore and learned the nature of mind and thought [or ‘of wisdom and
folly’]—matters on which Anaxagoras was continually discoursing—
and drew from it what was useful for the art of speaking.’ The famous
association of the two men is also mentioned in the First Alcibiades,
which if not by Plato himself is at any rate a fourth-century
work, and by Plato’s contemporary Isocrates, as welljas by later
authorittes.! Plutarch and Diodorus agree that the prdsecution of
Anaxagoras for impiety was at least partly due to the desire of Pericles’s
political opponents to attack him through his friendship with the
atheistic scientist. The same charge was brought against Aspasia.
Plutarch tells us that a special bill was introduced by Diopeithes, a
well-known religious fanatic, framed in general terms against ‘those
who do not acknowledge divine things or who give instruction about
celestial phenomena’, with this particular aim of discrediting Pericles
through Anaxagoras? A specific charge against him was thar, in the
Tonian tradition, he denied the divinity of the heavenly bodies. ‘He
called the sun a fiery stone” is the wording given in our later authorities,
and in the Apology, when Meletus asserts that Socrates ‘says the sun
is a stone and the moon earth’, Socrates asks him if he thinks it is
Anaxagoras that he is accusing, ‘whose books are full of that sort
of thing.3
   Anaxagoras was exiled, and ended his days at Lampsacus on the
southern shore of the Hellespont, where he was honoured in life
and remembered after death. There is a pleasant story that when
the anthorities of the city encouraged him to name a wish, he asked
that the children might be given a holiday in the month                               of his
death. The Lampsacenes gave him public burial and, says a writer
of the fourth century B.c., “honour him to this day’4 Before his
death he may have had time to teach and found a school there.
Eusebius says that his pupil Archelaus of Athens (the teacher of
Socrates) ‘succeeded to the school of Anaxagoras in Lampsacus’,

and A.E. Taylor argued strongly for the existence of a school of
philosophers in the city which it is most reasonable to account for in
this way.!
    Another who is said to have been, like Pericles, his pupil is Euripides.
For this however we have nothing like the authority of Plato. All the
testimonies are much later, and could have arisen out of references in
the plays, which cerrainly show that Euripides was a keen follower of
current theories of nature, and familiar with Anaxagoras’s works; and,
as Socrates says in the 4pology (26d), these could easily be bought in
the city for a drachma at the most, The most obvious allusion is the
description of the sun as a ‘rock’ and a ‘golden clod’ in a chorus of
the Orestes and a fragment of the Phaethon.?

                                               (2)   Writings
Diogenes Laertius (£.16) lists Anaxagoras among those who wrote
only one single treatise (8v olryypoupa). It was, he says (2.6), ‘written
in an attractive and dignified style’. This is of course the Physica, in
which he set forth his views on the first principles, matter and the
moving cause, and described the origin and present consiitution of the
cosmos. A copy was still available to Simplicius in the sixth century
A.p., and, in commenting on passages of Aristotle which deal with
Anaxagoras, he gives a number of quotations of varying length, which
constitute practically all the fragments thar we still possess. They in-
clude the opening words of the treatise, and seem to be all from the
first book, with the result that, so far as first-hand acquaintance goes,

Taylor should make so much of the mention, at the beginning of Plato’s Parmenides, of a group
of keen philosophers at Clagomenae as evidence for the foundation by Anaxagoras of a school at
Lampsacus, Taylor also says that in Roman imperial times Lampsacus placed his figure on 1ts
coins,   I cannot   trace   this   (he gives   na reference),   and   suspect   thac Tayloc has confused
Lampsacus with Clazomenae. The philosopher’s birthplace did put him on coins of both

we are better acquainted with the general principles than with the
details of Anaxagoras’s system.”
   Some have assumed from a sentence in Plutarch that when in prison
he wrote a work on the problem of squaring the circle, but as Burnet
pointed out, the words probably mean no more than that he beguiled
the time by attempting 10 work out the problem with figures on the
floor.? More plausible perhaps is the report that he wrote a treatise on
scene-painting and perspective. The authority is Vitruvius; who says
that after Agatharchus, who painted scenes for Aeschylus,                           Democritus
and Anaxagoras both wrote on the art of how to produce ‘definite
representations of buildings in scenic pictures and to bring ithbout that
of objects on a vertical plane surface some appear to retreat dnd others
to stand out’. This started an interesting speculation in the mind of
Erich Frank, who connected it with the statements of Plutarch that he
‘produced the first and clearest explanation in writing of the illumina-
tion and shadow of the moon’, and of Hippolytus that he “first cleared
up the question of its eclipses and shinings’. Anaxagoras, said Frank,
applied the discovery of perspective, made in his time and treated by
himself and Democritus, to the whole world.                       As a result he was the
first to construct the cone of the earth’s shadow and prove geometrically
the necessity of eclipses when the moon or sun entered it. Frank even
went so far as 10 say, relying on Hippolytus, that he used the laws of
perspective to estimate the sizes and distances of the sun and moon,
and recognized the marks on the moan as shadows caused by mountains,
‘With Anaxagoras the world practically gains a new dimension in the
Greek consciousness.3

others designed to show that a man may be happy and virmous whatever his surroundings, must
not be exaggerated.   Proclus indeed (Eucl. 65.21, A9) says tat he ‘applied himsel{ to many

   This extension to the cosmos of ideas derived from the laws of
perspective as applied to scene-painting is not %mpossible., and as a
possibility is oo interesting to pass over. But it is a precarious struc-
ture, and its foundation in the statement of an Augustan writer on
architecture cannot be claimed as unshakably firm.*

                              (3) The prablem of becorning
Like Empedocles, Anaxagoras accepted the Parmenidean canons that
there is no empty space? and that coming-into-being and perishing into
not-being are strictly impossible, and in general terms he accepted the
same alternative. ‘There is no birth nor death,” Empedocles had said,
‘but only mixture and separation of what has been mixed’ (fr. 8).
Anaxagoras put it thus (fr. 17): ‘The Greeks have a wrong conception
of becoming and perishing. Nothing comes to be or perishes, but there
is mixture and separation of things that exist. Thus they ought prop-
erly to call generation mixwure and extinction separation.” We notice
at once a difference between the two men. Empedocles had insisted on
a double process: both mixture and separation could in their turn be the
cause of both generation and destruction, two moving forces were
  * We need not agree with Burnet (EGP, 2§7) in regarding it as a *most improbable story ” that
Anaxagoras wrote a treatise on perspective. The passage in Vitruvius is expertly criticized by
E. Pfuhlin vol. 2 of his Malerei u, Zeicknung der Griechen, pp. 615, 666, 674~7. His main caveat
is against exaggerating the achievements of Agatharchus, The creator of illusionistic painting
(involving both perspective drawing and the use of light and shade 1o simulate sohdiry) was
Apollodorus, whose inventions must be dated ahout (and not later than) 430. Agatharchus,
Pfuhl thinks, with his very modest Kulissenmalerei, posed rather thaa solved the prablem,
Anaxagoras ook the first steps towards a theoretical understanding of it, and the first full masters
of perspective in practice and theory were Apollodorus and his philosophical contemporary
Democritus (p. 676).
  * This however, as Gigon has suggested (Philologus, 1936-7, 20-2), may not have played an
important part in his system. Ir is not mentioned in the extant fragments, nor in the doxography
‘when it is concerned with the &pyal. Aristotle coupled Anaxagoras with Empedacles at De caelo,
309219, and at Phys. 213222 he writes: “Those who try to demonstrate that there is no void do
not disprove what people mean by void but are in error, Such are Anaxagoras and those who use
his manner of dispraof. What they prove is that air is something, when they torture wineskins
%o show that it is powerful, and enciose it in clepsydras.” (Cf. pp. 224f. above.) As Gigon says,
we cannot believe that Anaxagoras's contemporaries took the air in an inflated skin to be nothing,
and he suggests chat the point may have lain rather in the foxupds, since Anaxagoras wishes his
readers to heheve that the air is strong enough to support the whole earth (loxupbraros Svra,
Hippol. Ref. 1.8.3, 442). It 15 also capable of pushing back the sun and moon at the Limis of
their courses (i4d. §9). The absence of void is mentioned once more in Aristotle in conhexion
with the breathing of fish (Ds resp. 4712 av yép dvau evéw), and later by Lucretiws (f.843f.

posited and the cosmic process was cyclic. With the religious motive
removed, a single force suffices and the cosmogonic process is in one
direction only.
   The solution of Empedocles had been to suppose that there was only
a strictly limited number of elemental substances which deserved to be
called existent. The rest, the world of ‘mortal’ things which we suppose
to be real, consisted simply of mixtures of the four ‘roots’ in different
proportions, which could be dissolved without infringing the rule of
‘nobecoming’. The condition laid downby Anaxagoras was Stricter; On
the Empedoclean theory,if it were possible to divide a piece of (say) flesh
into small enough fragments, the elements would come to light arid it
would be flesh no longer. But Anaxagoras held that if this were even
theoretically possible, then a definite substance, flesh, could perish.
There was no reason for singling out certain forms of matter like
earth or water as primary. Why should they be said to “exist’ more
than others? ‘How can hair come out of not-hair, and flesh out of
not-flesh?’ (fr. 10). All the infinite number of natural substances, flesh,
bone, hair, sinew, wood, iron, stone, etc. must be equally real. The
problem is most clearly seen in nutrition, and some passages suggest
that it was in fact the phenomenon of nutrition which led Anaxagoras
to consider it in this way. Besides fr. 10 just quoted, one may cite
Aét, 1.3.5 (446):
It seemed to him a baffling problem how anything can come into being out
of what is not, or perish into what is not. Yet we take in nourishment which
is simple and uniform, bread and water, and from this nourishment grow
hair, veins, arteries, flesh, sinews, bones and the other parts of the body.
(So also Simpl. Phys. 460.15, a45.)

Clearly therefore, if the rule of ‘no becoring, but only mingling and
separation’ is to be kept, Anaxagoras had set himself a much harder
task than Empedocles’s, and the answer will have to be correspondingly
more complex.
                                 (4) Mind
‘All things were together, then Mind (Nous) came and set them in
order.” This, says Diogenes (2.6), was the opening of Anaxagoras’s
book; and though we can see from Simplicius that it is rather a distil-

lation of his meaning than a verbatim quotation, it does indeed put his
whole theory of cosmogony in a nutshell. An account of his system
has therefore to face two main questions: (¢) What is the nature and
function of Mind? (#) What theory of the nature of physical reality
lies behind the statement that all things were together?
   The following are the actual surviving quotations from Anaxagoras’s
book which deal with Mind:
(Fr.12)     The rest have a portion of everything, but Mind is something
infinite’ and independent, and is mixed with no thing, but alone and by itself.
1f jt were not by itself, but were mixed with any other thing, it would have
had a share of all things if it were mixed with any, for there is a portion of
everything in everything, as T have said before. [CL. fr. 11 below.] And the
things mixed in it would have prevented it from controlling anything as it
can when alone and by itself. It is the finest and purest of all things, and has
all judgment of everything and greatest power; and everything that has life,
both greaser and smaller, all these Mind controls; and it controlled the whole
revolution, to make it revolve in the beginning: At first it began to revolve
in a small part, but now it revolves over a larger field and will include a
larger one still. And the things that are being mingled and those that are
being separated off and divided, Mind determined® them all. Mind set every-
thing in order, what was to be, what was? but is not now, and all that now is
and shall be, and this revolution in which revolve the stars, sun, moon, air
and fire* thar are being separated off. This revolution$ caused the separating
off. The dense is separated from the rare, the hot from the cold, the bright
from the dark, the dry from the wet. There are many portions of many
things, and no one thing is completely separated or divided from another

between knowledge and power is well brought out in Arist. De an. 429a19. It should however
ke noted chat Sunplicius took the word 10 mean that Mind &nows all things (Cael, 608.27-31).
His comment, # y&p yvéous Spizet kol Tepatol 7o yveaéy, implies, in its context, not so much
that knowledge has the power to determine, as that what cannot be determined or limited cannot
be the object of knowledge.

is like anything else,’ but those things are and were most plainly each thing,
of which there are most in it.
    Parts of this quotation refer to aspects of the constitution of matter
which must be left till fater, but it has been quoted entire to put the
description of Mind in its full functional context.

in some things is Mind ro0.
(Fr. 13) After Mind initiated motion, it began to withdraw® fr o all that
was moved, and all that Mind moved was divided. And as th1s motion

(Fr. 14)      Mind, which is for ever, is assuredly even now wheré all other
things are also,3 in the great quantity surrounding and in the things which
have been brought together and those which have been separated.
    The general opinion of ancient critics was that Anaxagoras had
taken a tremendous step forward by clearly separating, for the first
time, the moving cause from the matter moved, and by characteriz-
ing this separate cause as Mind or Intellection. Ou the other hand
he had shown a tendency to confine the action of Mind to the first
step of initiating motion in what had been a motionless mass.
The     rest of the         process     he explained          by   the    operation       of non-
intelligent causes: the motion set going by mind being a rotatory one,
everything else followed through the mechanical action of a vortex
on the bodies caught up in ir. Plato makes Socrates say (Phaedo,
  T A, Wasserstein (CR, 1960, 4f) suggests deleting ot8evl. Mind is ‘all alike” incernally, Le. is
homogeneous, and the logical contrast is to say that every other thing is 7ot alike, in the same
sense, namely because each contairs a partion of everything else, rather than that the other diings
do not resemble each other. This makes Anaxagorean sense, but hardly seems necessary. Cf.

                    Mind: Criticism of Plato and Others
97b#L.) that when he heard someone reading from abook of Anaxagoras
that Mind was the prime cause and had set everything in order he was
delighted, but that reading further brought bitter disappointment, for
he found the author making no use of Mind in the actual ordering of
things but putting it all down to ‘airs, ethers, waters and many other
strange things’. The reason for Socrates’s disappointment was that he
was looking for a teleological explanation of the world and thought it
the only explanation possible on the assumption that it was controlled
by Mind. Mind must have ordered things for the best, so that in Mind’s
world, if one wanted to know the reason why anything was generated
or destroyed, it should only be necessary to ask in what way it was
best for it to exist or to be affected.              But this was not the method of
Anaxagoras.
   Aristotle echoed Plato’s verdict. Anaxagoras, by affirming that just
as living creatures have nows, so in nature as a whole nous is the cause
of the cosmos and of motion everywhere, ‘stood out like a single sober
man by comparison with the wild assertions of his predecessors’
(Metaph. 984b15). On the other hand (985218), he “uses Mind as a
mechanical device for world-making. When he is at a loss for the reason
why something necessarily is, then he drags it in, but elsewhere he
explains events by everything rather than Mind.”*
   In later antiquity Proclus (in Tim. vol. 1, p. 2 Diehl) varies the meta-
phor by saying that Anaxagoras appears to have seen that Mind was the
cause of becoming ‘while the others were asleep’, but for the rest he is
content to quote the Phaedo. Simplicius however comments with more
independence on Socrates’s criticisms:
“That for which Socrates in the Phaedo blames Anaxagoras,” he writes (Phys.
177.9), ‘namely that for the causes of particular events he makes no use of
Mind, but only of materialistic explanations, s in fact the method proper to
a study of nature. For that very reason even Plato himself in the Timaeus,
   ! It would appear, then, that Aristotle’s praise of Anaxagoras is due not so much to the nature
of his motive cause as to the fact that he provided a separate motive cause at all. Some have
thought this an indication that Aristatle looks on him as prior in time to Empedacles. More
probably he does not regard the concepts of Love and Strife as being strictly separate from the
elements. Love for instance seemed 10 him to combine in an unsatistactory way the character~
istics of material and of efficient cause (dpx# ydp kel bs avoloa, . .kal &g UAn* pépiov yép ol
wiyueros, Metaph. 1o75b3). His criticism of Anaxagoras was echoed by his pupil Eudemus (see
x37 ad fin).

after he has stated in general terms the cause responsible for all things, when
he comes to details cites as causes differences of size and shape, hot and cold
and so on. Socrates however, becanse he wants 10 demonstrate the teleo-
logical explanation, mentions Anaxagoras as making use of the material but
not the final cause.’
This is an acute assessment, and shows how                      much     Plato’s interest in
secandary causes had grown by the time that he attempted, in the
 Timaeus, to emulate his predecessors by putting together for, himself a
complete cosmogony, cosmology and descriptive account OE animate
and inanimate nature. It will be of interest to keep these Greek verdicts
in mind when we are examining the fragments ourselves.
    ‘Mind is something apeiron and self-ruling, and is mixed\with no
thing.” It is apeiron in all the main senses of that word: infinite or
indefinite in extent, for it is wherever marter is (fr. 14), and that is com-
posed of patticles infinite in tumber (frr. 1 and 1}; infinite in time, for
it exists for ever (fr. 14); and internally without boundaries, for it is
homogeneous, ‘all alike” (fr. 12 ad fin.). It is unmixed, ‘for if it were
mixed with any other thing it would have a share of all things, for there
is a portion of everything in everything’. 1f Mind were a part of the
mixture, it would have something of every kind of matter in it, for that
is a condition of existence of matter. Everything contains portions of
every other thing. This is basic to Anaxagoras’s theory of matter, to
which we shall come later. ‘And the things mixed in it would have
prevented 1t from controlling anything as it can when alone and by
itself.” Here we have, clearly stated by Anaxagoras himself, what in
the eyes of Aristotle and others was his greatest achievement, namely
the realization that the moving and controlling force must be entirely
separate from the matter which it moves.
   ‘It is the finest and purest of all things, and has all knowledge of
everything and greatest power.” The epithets used are lepron and
katharon. Lepton is a word commonly used with a material denotation,
applied to finely woven materials, spiders’ webs, finely ground powder
and so forth, and its use here has sometimes been taken as evidence that
Mind is still being thought ofas corporeal.” Since however it is already

meaningless to say that the immaterul is ** thinner”” than the macecial’ (Burnet, £GP, 268).

used of counsel or wisdom (pfjTis) in the Jliad, it is hardly worth
repeating the many occasions on which it is used with similar non-
material subjects in classical Greek,”                 If Anaxagoras had at last grasped
the idea of non-material existence, he obviously had not the vocabulary
in which to express it. Even now it is notoriously difficult to speak of
mind or spirit without borrowing the terminology of the material
world. (‘Spirit” itself is an example.) Knowing no positive epithets to
apply to the non-material as such, Anaxagoras could only describe it
pegatively as not being matter. This he seems to do emphatically in
his repeated insistence that it is entirely separate from the mixture of
everything which we should call matter. Mind is that aspect of Anaxi-
mander’s apeiron which ‘steers all things’, tAar aspect of Heraclitus's
fire which deserved the name of Jogos and was wise; but the divine and
ruling faculty of Anaximander’s arcke has been recognized as incom-
patible with its identification with a corporeal mass, the logos of Hera-
clitus has been released from its uncomfortable association with fire.
    This judgment is in no way affected by the use of the epithet epzon.
If it needs to be qualified at all, it must be by the hint [ater in fr. 12 that
there can be ‘greater and lesser’ quantities of Mind, and the statement
infr. 14 that it is “ where all other things are’. It may be that Anaxagoras
thought of Mind as being, though invisible and intangible, extended in
space. Apeiron probably does imply that in order to control the mass,
it had in some way to permeate it, although at the same time keeping
itself separate from the bodies within it. Yet the phrase ‘the greater and
the lesser” is introduced for the purpose of once again contrasting Mind

and in fifth-century literature also 1o Mipos, ppves, Bamils, k8ol It would be perverse to argue
that since philosophers themselves are at this time only on the threshold of an explicit distinction
berween mind and marter, others can have been conscious of no such distinction and may have
thought of the entitzes just histed as being of the same order as blood or wood. (The gpéves were
of course originally a part of the body.) The point is that they were fully capable of using a word
metaphorically, and were obviously doing so in the cases cited. Homer also speaks of Ugatvew
witriv ({1, 7.324, etc.), but we do not suppose on that account that he thought of 2 pfmis as some-
thing made of wool or stting. P. Leon has some sensible remarks on this point in @, 1927,

Smaller and greater parts of this do differ, for it is not homogeneous
but made up of portions characterized by different physical factors
which in the aggregate are manifest to sense, whereas ‘Mind is ail alike,
in any quantity’.          If any shred of materialism remains, it is very slight
indeed.* A Christian who believes that God ‘dwelleth not in temples
made with hands’ will still say that he is ‘everywhere’.
   Next we are told that Mind has a special relation 1o the organic
world. ‘Everything that has life’,.fr. 12 continues, ‘both greater and
smaller, all these Mind controls; and it controlled the whole revolution,
to make it revolve in the beginning.” Here is another handle for the
criticism of Plato and Aristotle. We note the different tenscs, Mind
was necessary to start the revolution in the beginning, for another
epoch-making innovation of Anaxagoras was to say explicitly that
everything started from a state of rest into which motion had to be
introduced for the first time. The cosmos is not just a stage in an endless
cyclical process as with Empedocles. Aristotle reports (Phys. 250b24):
‘He says that all things were together and at rest for an infinite time,
then Mind set them in motion and divided them.” Once the initial push
had been administered, the revolution continued of its own momentum
at an ever-increasing speed. The control of Mind over living creatures,
on the other hand, continues still. That life should stand in a specially
close relation to the intelligent cosmic force is a natural assumption
and in line with earlier thought. Living things in fact contain it. This
   ¢ The difficalty of conceiving anything as existing, in any sense, which was not extended in
space, may be illustrated by a comparison with a later age. Basil Willey writes \n The Seventeenth
Century Background (p. 165): *Such authority had the notion of *“Extension” 1n the seventeenth
century, as the essential attribute of the admittedly “real” (matter), that unless one could atrribute
“extension"” 10 a substance, that substance was in danger of evaporating into nethingness. This
was Henry More’s fear for *spirit”; Descartes by affirming spirit as a mere abstraction was
really, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, beginning upon the slippery slope 1owards
materialism and atheism.    It was safer, in More’s opinion, to admit frankly that extension is a
necessary attribute of all that exists, and 1o demonstrate, further, that spirit, 2s a real being, must
he extended also. He was anxious fo claim extension for spirit, “that it may be conceived to be
some real Being and true Substance, and not a vain Figment, such as is everything thar has no
Amplitude and is in no sost extended . (True Notion of a Spirit, p. 41.)> </p>

dilution in the process. For the mystic, small portions of it are imprisoned
in the bodies of men and animals, and even of plants. According to
a widespread belief it was the ‘divine aither’ (Aesch. P.V. 88), into
which the immortal mind of a man plunged at death (Eur. He/. 1014).
Another quotation from Euripides reflects his reading of the philo-
<p>sophers and comes closer to Empedocles’s own ideas:<em> ‘All things
return, the products of earth to earth, but those that have sprung from
actherial seed go back 1o the vault of heaven. Nothing dies that is
born, but separated one from another they reveal a differentiform.’ In
this striking passage Euripides echoes the words of Empedqcles fr. 8,
that there is no such thing as death, but only separation of wha\; has been
unified, and shows how easily such an apparently physical doctrine could
be combined with a religious belief in fallen spirits and their ultimate
reunion with the divine nature. The doctrine of ‘like to like’ and the
combination of earthly and heavenly in mortal creatures could take their
place together in a rational scheme of the natural world, ver recur in the
Orphic myth of the origin of the human race from the earth-born Titans
who had devoured Dionysus and were reduced 10 ashes by the thunder-
bolt of Zeus; and another parallel to the lines of Euripides is found in the
mystic’s boast inscribed on a gold tablet from a South Italian tomb:
‘Tam a son of Earth and starry Heaven, yet is my lineage of Heaven.”
Empedocles did not give the popular name aitker to divinity in its
<p>uncontaminated state. This word, which in earlier and contemporary
literature had been somewhat loosely and ambiguously used? he
appropriated for one of his four ‘roots’, air in its elemental purity. This

to be apprehended only by the responsive element of divinity in our-
selves. It was probably (though to affirm this goes slightly beyond the
evidence) the element of intra-cosmic Love or goodness, ‘ whereby men
think kindly thoughts and do peaceful works’. By separating divinity
fram the four elements Empedocles may have assisted the emergence
of the ‘fifth element’, which when we meet it fully developed in Aristotle
is divine, the substance of the stars which are gods. Possibly, however,
although he did not advance to the idea of purely incorporeal being,
he was nearer to it than some of his successors when he refused to
identify it with any of the ‘roots’ but called it ‘only a holy and in-
expressible mind’.
1t may seem strange, perhaps indefensible, to believe in a divine
<p>Mind and in our own true selves as incarnated, individualized fragments
of it, and at the same time to explain the physical universe by causes
which interact in a purely fortuitous way. Yet it was of the essence
of early Greek mysticism to hold, not that the divine was respansible for
the ordering of matter as it is, but that the whole cosmic order was
the enemy of divinity. We think in terms of Platonism and Christianity,
bur it was a conscious protest against the prevailing view when Socrates
and Plato argued that if there is a divine Mind, then it must have
ordered the world for the best.</p>

                 (8)    The nature and destiny of the * soul’*
<p>The Greek word psyche, which is usually transtated ‘soul’, occurs only
once in the fragments of Empedocles, in the sense of <em>life’. To take life
is to draw off the psyche (fr. 138). Itis improbable that he used it either
for the combined faculties of sensation and thought, which depend on
the blood and other bodily organs, or for the divine spark in us which
is alien to the body and which he called daimon. By using the word
‘soul” to cover both of these, earlier interpreters puzzled themselves or
accused Empedocles of blatant inconsistency in saying in the poem on
nature that the soul died with the body, and in the Purifications thatit was
an immortal spirit. That particular difficulty should no longer trouble
us. The faculties whereby we live in the body and have cognizance

of the physical objects around us consist of various blends of the same
elements as these physical objects—necessarily so, for like is per-
ceived by like. That in us by which we are capable of having know-~
ledge and understanding (as opposed to ‘dark opinions’) of the divine
is quite different, since by the same rule it must itself be divine. The
Hesiodic lore of the spirits of heroes becoming ‘good daimones’ after
their death had already been developed and altered by Orphic and
Pythagorean doctrine, but Empedocles probably stiil had 1t in mind,
and he (or his Orphic sources) had combined it with the sto;y of gods
exiled from heaven for their sins. In Hesiod the men of the Golden
Race after their death became ‘good daimones through the will of great
Zeus, dwelling on earth, guardians of mortal men, who warch over
righteous and evil deeds, going up and down over the land clad in
darkness’ (£rga, 121-5). Empedocles may have thought also of the
spirits of men, between incarnations and before final apotheosis, as
performing a similar function, for Hippolytus says: ‘Empedocles
spoke much about the nature of daimones, saying that there are a
great many of them and they go up and down directing earthly
affairs.’? 1t should not be necessary to enlarge further on the fact
that the word ‘soul” has been commonly used to cover what in
ancient belief were two distinct entities, for this has been done earlier
in connexion with the Pythagoreans. (See vol.1,317-19.) The duality
was surprisingly persistent, for it appears even in Aristotle. His general
theory of psyche as the actuality of an organic body left no room for
belief in immortality, in which in his maturity he had little incerest. He
was no mystic, scoffed at the idea of transmigration, and had nothing
to say about rewards or punishments in a future life. Yet it still seemed
to him that there must be one human faculty, namely noxs or the power
of intuitive apprehension, which falls outside the general natuze of the
psyche. 1t <em>appears to be a generically different manifestation of soul,
which alone is capable of separation, as the eternal {rom the perishable’.
Nous alone ‘enters from outside and alone is divine’.

<p>                        The Fate of the Daimon
 In Empedocles, what enters from outside, alien 10 the body in which
<p>it finds itself, is the daimon. It is there as a punishment for following the
ways of Strife, and to earn its release it must rurn, Jike the blessed ones
ofan earlier age, to the worship and service of Apbrodite or Love.         Its
final reward is to be for ever rid of the body and restored to divine
status, Mare than that the fragments do not say, but the nature both of
his system and of similar religious statements of the time encourages a
guess: it achieves a inode of union with the source of all unity, harmony
and goodness, and with the divine Mind to which it proved its affinity
even on earth, by turning away from the elemental compounds and seek-
ing, like to like, the knowledge of what is not to be seen with the eyes
orgrasped with the hands. As the Orphic devotee suppressed the Titanic
and cherished the Dionysiac within him, so the follower of Empedocles
must abjure the works of Strife and cultivate the spirit of Cypris. Of
all this—Love, divine Mind, daimones—we have learned something in
the preceding pages. Time, the loss of the greater part of his poems,
and the unique character of Empedocles himself forbid us to hope for
certainty on all the ultimate beliefs which he drew ex adyto tamguam
cordis.   But not the least part of his fascination lies in the way that, as
we saw at the beginning and now know better, he typifies the complex-
icy of the Greek mind of his time. Some love the Greeks for their
rational achievement, their classical sense of form, proportion, sym-
metry and order. Others exalt the romantic, Dionysiac strain of
enthusiasmos in which reason abdicates and man feels the ecstatic joy
of possession by the god. We may be capable of responding to one side
only of this contrast, but if we would do justice to the Hellenic spirit
we must recognize that it included both; and we are helped to under-
stand this by the knowledge that they were combined not only in one
people bur in one man, Empedocles of Acragas.</p>

                            ANAXAGORAS
<p>With Anaxagoras we return from Western Greece to Ionia, both geo-
graphically and in spirit. Coming from Clazomenae near Smyrna, he
is described as a philosophical heir of Anaximenes,<em> and ceftainly the
spirit of the old Milesian school is revived in him.                  Uncomplicated by
the passionate religious feelings that moved Empedocles, hiy thought
returns to the lonian tradition of free inquiry, motivated byicuriosity
alone and governed by a purely scientific temperament. The change is
also marked, as we might expect, by a return to prose as the medium
of expression.       He deserves special notice as the man who                      brought
Tonian physical speculation to Athens at the height of her political and
intellectual development, for he spent thirty years of his life there and
was a close friend of Pericles.
                                 (1) Date and life
<p>Anaxagoras son of Hegesibulus of Clazomenae was older, but only a
little older, than Empedocles. Which of the two produced his work first
is a matter of controversy, but the opinion may be hazarded that
Empedocles links up more directly with Parmenides, and that Anaxa-
goras wrote slightly later and possibly with knowledge of the poems of
Empedocles.? He was born, it would seem, about 500 B.C., and the
thirty years which he spent in Athens ended in his exile to Lampsacus,
where he died about 428 (the year of Plato’s birth, as Hippolytus
remarked) aged seventy-two. Hisbook was finished later than 467, the
year of the fall of the meteorite at Aegospotami (p. 302 below). So much
may be said with confidence, though the more detailed chronology of
his life is a matter of some dispute.3 Coming from a wealthy family,

he showed no interest in money but gave up his inheritance and the
political influence that it might have brought, to devote himself single-
mindedly to science and philosophy. This is mentioned by Plato, and
Aristotle comments more than once on his lack of interest in practical
matters, There wasalso a story currentin Aristotle’s time that whenasked
why tobeborn was better than not to be born (a form in which pessimism
about human life was often expressed by Greek poets), he replied that
a man would choose to be born ‘in order to study the heavens and the
whole universe’. Clearly there was factual foundation for the character
of typical unworldly philosopher which he assumes in later writers. It
was said that when he received at the same time the news of his own
condemnation and the death of his son (or sons), he commented on
the former, ‘ Both my judges and I were sentenced long ago by nature’,
and on the latter, ‘T knew that I had begotten them mortal’.! Again,
when he was reproached for his fack of interest in public affairs, as
implying neglect of his fatherland, he is said to have replied that he
did indeed care for his fatherland—pointing to the heavens.                               The
implication, that he belonged to the whole cosmos, was not in-
tended to indicate any sympathy with the religion of his time, to
which, at least in its more superstitious forms, he is consistently
represented as in opposition.            Plutarch tells that a countryman brought
to Pericles the head of a ram which had a single hom growing
from the middle of its forehead. The soothsayer Lampon interpreted
this as meaning that of the two rivals for supreme power, Pericles
and Thucydides, that one would prevail to whom the head had been
brought. Anaxagoras however had the skull split open and in a
brief anatomical lecture explained the natural reasons for the anomaly.
The people, says Plutarch, were full of admiration for his know-
ledge, but transferred           their admiration to Lampon                 when     a short
time afterwards Thucydides fell and Pericles took over sole control
of Athens.®

what Pericles acquired to supplement his natural gifts. In Anaxagoras
he found, I think, that kind of man, stored his mind with astronomical
Tore and learned the nature of mind and thought [or ‘of wisdom and
folly’]—matters on which Anaxagoras was continually discoursing—
and drew from it what was useful for the art of speaking.’ The famous
association of the two men is also mentioned in the First Alcibiades,
which if not by Plato himself is at any rate a fourth-century
work, and by Plato’s contemporary Isocrates, as welljas by later
authorittes.! Plutarch and Diodorus agree that the prdsecution of
Anaxagoras for impiety was at least partly due to the desire of Pericles’s
political opponents to attack him through his friendship with the
atheistic scientist. The same charge was brought against Aspasia.
Plutarch tells us that a special bill was introduced by Diopeithes, a
well-known religious fanatic, framed in general terms against ‘those
who do not acknowledge divine things or who give instruction about
celestial phenomena’, with this particular aim of discrediting Pericles
through Anaxagoras? A specific charge against him was thar, in the
Tonian tradition, he denied the divinity of the heavenly bodies. ‘He
called the sun a fiery stone” is the wording given in our later authorities,
and in the Apology, when Meletus asserts that Socrates ‘says the sun
is a stone and the moon earth’, Socrates asks him if he thinks it is
Anaxagoras that he is accusing, ‘whose books are full of that sort
of thing.3
Anaxagoras was exiled, and ended his days at Lampsacus on the
<p>southern shore of the Hellespont, where he was honoured in life
and remembered after death. There is a pleasant story that when
the anthorities of the city encouraged him to name a wish, he asked
that the children might be given a holiday in the month                               of his
death. The Lampsacenes gave him public burial and, says a writer
of the fourth century B.c., “honour him to this day’4 Before his
death he may have had time to teach and found a school there.
Eusebius says that his pupil Archelaus of Athens (the teacher of
Socrates) ‘succeeded to the school of Anaxagoras in Lampsacus’,</p>

 Another who is said to have been, like Pericles, his pupil is Euripides.
<p>For this however we have nothing like the authority of Plato. All the
testimonies are much later, and could have arisen out of references in
the plays, which cerrainly show that Euripides was a keen follower of
current theories of nature, and familiar with Anaxagoras’s works; and,
as Socrates says in the 4pology (26d), these could easily be bought in
the city for a drachma at the most, The most obvious allusion is the
description of the sun as a ‘rock’ and a ‘golden clod’ in a chorus of
the Orestes and a fragment of the Phaethon.?</p>

<p>Diogenes Laertius (£.16) lists Anaxagoras among those who wrote
only one single treatise (8v olryypoupa). It was, he says (2.6), ‘written
in an attractive and dignified style’. This is of course the Physica, in
which he set forth his views on the first principles, matter and the
moving cause, and described the origin and present consiitution of the
cosmos. A copy was still available to Simplicius in the sixth century
A.p., and, in commenting on passages of Aristotle which deal with
Anaxagoras, he gives a number of quotations of varying length, which
constitute practically all the fragments thar we still possess. They in-
clude the opening words of the treatise, and seem to be all from the
first book, with the result that, so far as first-hand acquaintance goes,</p>

<p>Taylor should make so much of the mention, at the beginning of Plato’s Parmenides, of a group
of keen philosophers at Clagomenae as evidence for the foundation by Anaxagoras of a school at
Lampsacus, Taylor also says that in Roman imperial times Lampsacus placed his figure on 1ts
coins,   I cannot   trace   this   (he gives   na reference),   and   suspect   thac Tayloc has confused
Lampsacus with Clazomenae. The philosopher’s birthplace did put him on coins of both

we are better acquainted with the general principles than with the
details of Anaxagoras’s system.”
Some have assumed from a sentence in Plutarch that when in prison
<p>he wrote a work on the problem of squaring the circle, but as Burnet
pointed out, the words probably mean no more than that he beguiled
the time by attempting 10 work out the problem with figures on the
floor.? More plausible perhaps is the report that he wrote a treatise on
scene-painting and perspective. The authority is Vitruvius; who says
that after Agatharchus, who painted scenes for Aeschylus,                           Democritus
and Anaxagoras both wrote on the art of how to produce ‘definite
representations of buildings in scenic pictures and to bring ithbout that
of objects on a vertical plane surface some appear to retreat dnd others
to stand out’. This started an interesting speculation in the mind of
Erich Frank, who connected it with the statements of Plutarch that he
‘produced the first and clearest explanation in writing of the illumina-
tion and shadow of the moon’, and of Hippolytus that he “first cleared
up the question of its eclipses and shinings’. Anaxagoras, said Frank,
applied the discovery of perspective, made in his time and treated by
himself and Democritus, to the whole world.                       As a result he was the
first to construct the cone of the earth’s shadow and prove geometrically
the necessity of eclipses when the moon or sun entered it. Frank even
went so far as 10 say, relying on Hippolytus, that he used the laws of
perspective to estimate the sizes and distances of the sun and moon,
and recognized the marks on the moan as shadows caused by mountains,
‘With Anaxagoras the world practically gains a new dimension in the
Greek consciousness.3

This extension to the cosmos of ideas derived from the laws of
<p>perspective as applied to scene-painting is not %mpossible., and as a

                           (3) The prablem of becorning
<p>Like Empedocles, Anaxagoras accepted the Parmenidean canons that
there is no empty space? and that coming-into-being and perishing into
not-being are strictly impossible, and in general terms he accepted the
same alternative. ‘There is no birth nor death,” Empedocles had said,
‘but only mixture and separation of what has been mixed’ (fr. 8).
Anaxagoras put it thus (fr. 17): ‘The Greeks have a wrong conception
of becoming and perishing. Nothing comes to be or perishes, but there
is mixture and separation of things that exist. Thus they ought prop-
erly to call generation mixwure and extinction separation.” We notice
at once a difference between the two men. Empedocles had insisted on
a double process: both mixture and separation could in their turn be the
cause of both generation and destruction, two moving forces were
  <em> We need not agree with Burnet (EGP, 2§7) in regarding it as a </em>most improbable story ” that
Anaxagoras wrote a treatise on perspective. The passage in Vitruvius is expertly criticized by
E. Pfuhlin vol. 2 of his Malerei u, Zeicknung der Griechen, pp. 615, 666, 674~7. His main caveat
is against exaggerating the achievements of Agatharchus, The creator of illusionistic painting
(involving both perspective drawing and the use of light and shade 1o simulate sohdiry) was
Apollodorus, whose inventions must be dated ahout (and not later than) 430. Agatharchus,
Pfuhl thinks, with his very modest Kulissenmalerei, posed rather thaa solved the prablem,
Anaxagoras ook the first steps towards a theoretical understanding of it, and the first full masters
of perspective in practice and theory were Apollodorus and his philosophical contemporary
Democritus (p. 676).
  * This however, as Gigon has suggested (Philologus, 1936-7, 20-2), may not have played an
important part in his system. Ir is not mentioned in the extant fragments, nor in the doxography
‘when it is concerned with the &amp;pyal. Aristotle coupled Anaxagoras with Empedacles at De caelo,
309219, and at Phys. 213222 he writes: “Those who try to demonstrate that there is no void do
not disprove what people mean by void but are in error, Such are Anaxagoras and those who use
his manner of dispraof. What they prove is that air is something, when they torture wineskins
%o show that it is powerful, and enciose it in clepsydras.” (Cf. pp. 224f. above.) As Gigon says,
we cannot believe that Anaxagoras's contemporaries took the air in an inflated skin to be nothing,
and he suggests chat the point may have lain rather in the foxupds, since Anaxagoras wishes his
readers to heheve that the air is strong enough to support the whole earth (loxupbraros Svra,
Hippol. Ref. 1.8.3, 442). It 15 also capable of pushing back the sun and moon at the Limis of
their courses (i4d. §9). The absence of void is mentioned once more in Aristotle in conhexion
with the breathing of fish (Ds resp. 4712 av yép dvau evéw), and later by Lucretiws (f.843f.

posited and the cosmic process was cyclic. With the religious motive
removed, a single force suffices and the cosmogonic process is in one
direction only.
The solution of Empedocles had been to suppose that there was only
<p>a strictly limited number of elemental substances which deserved to be
called existent. The rest, the world of ‘mortal’ things which we suppose
to be real, consisted simply of mixtures of the four ‘roots’ in different
proportions, which could be dissolved without infringing the rule of
‘nobecoming’. The condition laid downby Anaxagoras was Stricter; On
the Empedoclean theory,if it were possible to divide a piece of (say) flesh
into small enough fragments, the elements would come to light arid it
would be flesh no longer. But Anaxagoras held that if this were even
theoretically possible, then a definite substance, flesh, could perish.
There was no reason for singling out certain forms of matter like
earth or water as primary. Why should they be said to “exist’ more
than others? ‘How can hair come out of not-hair, and flesh out of
not-flesh?’ (fr. 10). All the infinite number of natural substances, flesh,
bone, hair, sinew, wood, iron, stone, etc. must be equally real. The
problem is most clearly seen in nutrition, and some passages suggest
that it was in fact the phenomenon of nutrition which led Anaxagoras
to consider it in this way. Besides fr. 10 just quoted, one may cite
Aét, 1.3.5 (446):
It seemed to him a baffling problem how anything can come into being out
of what is not, or perish into what is not. Yet we take in nourishment which
is simple and uniform, bread and water, and from this nourishment grow
hair, veins, arteries, flesh, sinews, bones and the other parts of the body.

</p>
<p>Clearly therefore, if the rule of ‘no becoring, but only mingling and
separation’ is to be kept, Anaxagoras had set himself a much harder
task than Empedocles’s, and the answer will have to be correspondingly
more complex.
                              (4) Mind
<p>‘All things were together, then Mind (Nous) came and set them in
order.” This, says Diogenes (2.6), was the opening of Anaxagoras’s
book; and though we can see from Simplicius that it is rather a distil-

lation of his meaning than a verbatim quotation, it does indeed put his
whole theory of cosmogony in a nutshell. An account of his system
has therefore to face two main questions: (¢) What is the nature and
function of Mind? (#) What theory of the nature of physical reality
lies behind the statement that all things were together?
The following are the actual surviving quotations from Anaxagoras’s
<p>book which deal with Mind:
(Fr.12)     The rest have a portion of everything, but Mind is something
infinite’ and independent, and is mixed with no thing, but alone and by itself.
1f jt were not by itself, but were mixed with any other thing, it would have
had a share of all things if it were mixed with any, for there is a portion of
everything in everything, as T have said before. [CL. fr. 11 below.] And the
things mixed in it would have prevented it from controlling anything as it
can when alone and by itself. It is the finest and purest of all things, and has
all judgment of everything and greatest power; and everything that has life,
both greaser and smaller, all these Mind controls; and it controlled the whole
revolution, to make it revolve in the beginning: At first it began to revolve
in a small part, but now it revolves over a larger field and will include a
larger one still. And the things that are being mingled and those that are
being separated off and divided, Mind determined® them all. Mind set every-
thing in order, what was to be, what was? but is not now, and all that now is
and shall be, and this revolution in which revolve the stars, sun, moon, air
and fire* thar are being separated off. This revolution$ caused the separating
off. The dense is separated from the rare, the hot from the cold, the bright
from the dark, the dry from the wet. There are many portions of many
things, and no one thing is completely separated or divided from another</p>

of which there are most in it.
 Parts of this quotation refer to aspects of the constitution of matter
<p>which must be left till fater, but it has been quoted entire to put the
description of Mind in its full functional context.
(Fr. 11) In everything there is a portion of everything except Mz’nd, and
in some things is Mind ro0.
(Fr. 13) After Mind initiated motion, it began to withdraw® fr o all that
was moved, and all that Mind moved was divided. And as th1s motion
and division went on the revolution caused it to be divided mufh more.
(Fr. 14)      Mind, which is for ever, is assuredly even now wheré all other
things are also,3 in the great quantity surrounding and in the things which
have been brought together and those which have been separated.
 The general opinion of ancient critics was that Anaxagoras had
<p>taken a tremendous step forward by clearly separating, for the first
time, the moving cause from the matter moved, and by characteriz-
ing this separate cause as Mind or Intellection. Ou the other hand
he had shown a tendency to confine the action of Mind to the first
step of initiating motion in what had been a motionless mass.
The     rest of the         process     he explained          by   the    operation       of non-
intelligent causes: the motion set going by mind being a rotatory one,
everything else followed through the mechanical action of a vortex
on the bodies caught up in ir. Plato makes Socrates say (Phaedo,
  T A, Wasserstein (CR, 1960, 4f) suggests deleting ot8evl. Mind is ‘all alike” incernally, Le. is
homogeneous, and the logical contrast is to say that every other thing is 7ot alike, in the same
sense, namely because each contairs a partion of everything else, rather than that the other diings
do not resemble each other. This makes Anaxagorean sense, but hardly seems necessary. Cf.

<p>                    Mind: Criticism of Plato and Others
97b#L.) that when he heard someone reading from abook of Anaxagoras
that Mind was the prime cause and had set everything in order he was
delighted, but that reading further brought bitter disappointment, for
he found the author making no use of Mind in the actual ordering of
things but putting it all down to ‘airs, ethers, waters and many other
strange things’. The reason for Socrates’s disappointment was that he
was looking for a teleological explanation of the world and thought it
the only explanation possible on the assumption that it was controlled
by Mind. Mind must have ordered things for the best, so that in Mind’s
world, if one wanted to know the reason why anything was generated
or destroyed, it should only be necessary to ask in what way it was
best for it to exist or to be affected.              But this was not the method of
Anaxagoras.
Aristotle echoed Plato’s verdict. Anaxagoras, by affirming that just
<p>as living creatures have nows, so in nature as a whole nous is the cause
of the cosmos and of motion everywhere, ‘stood out like a single sober
man by comparison with the wild assertions of his predecessors’
(Metaph. 984b15). On the other hand (985218), he “uses Mind as a
mechanical device for world-making. When he is at a loss for the reason
why something necessarily is, then he drags it in, but elsewhere he
explains events by everything rather than Mind.”<em>
In later antiquity Proclus (in Tim. vol. 1, p. 2 Diehl) varies the meta-
<p>phor by saying that Anaxagoras appears to have seen that Mind was the
cause of becoming ‘while the others were asleep’, but for the rest he is
content to quote the Phaedo. Simplicius however comments with more
independence on Socrates’s criticisms:
“That for which Socrates in the Phaedo blames Anaxagoras,” he writes (Phys.
177.9), ‘namely that for the causes of particular events he makes no use of
Mind, but only of materialistic explanations, s in fact the method proper to
a study of nature. For that very reason even Plato himself in the Timaeus,
! It would appear, then, that Aristotle’s praise of Anaxagoras is due not so much to the nature
<p>of his motive cause as to the fact that he provided a separate motive cause at all. Some have
thought this an indication that Aristatle looks on him as prior in time to Empedacles. More
probably he does not regard the concepts of Love and Strife as being strictly separate from the
elements. Love for instance seemed 10 him to combine in an unsatistactory way the character~
istics of material and of efficient cause (dpx# ydp kel bs avoloa, . .kal &amp;g UAn</p>

after he has stated in general terms the cause responsible for all things, when
he comes to details cites as causes differences of size and shape, hot and cold
and so on. Socrates however, becanse he wants 10 demonstrate the teleo-
logical explanation, mentions Anaxagoras as making use of the material but
not the final cause.’
This is an acute assessment, and shows how                      much     Plato’s interest in
secandary causes had grown by the time that he attempted, in the
 Timaeus, to emulate his predecessors by putting together for, himself a
complete cosmogony, cosmology and descriptive account OE animate
and inanimate nature. It will be of interest to keep these Greek verdicts
in mind when we are examining the fragments ourselves.
 ‘Mind is something apeiron and self-ruling, and is mixed\with no
<p>thing.” It is apeiron in all the main senses of that word: infinite or
indefinite in extent, for it is wherever marter is (fr. 14), and that is com-
posed of patticles infinite in tumber (frr. 1 and 1}; infinite in time, for
it exists for ever (fr. 14); and internally without boundaries, for it is
homogeneous, ‘all alike” (fr. 12 ad fin.). It is unmixed, ‘for if it were
mixed with any other thing it would have a share of all things, for there
is a portion of everything in everything’. 1f Mind were a part of the
mixture, it would have something of every kind of matter in it, for that
is a condition of existence of matter. Everything contains portions of
every other thing. This is basic to Anaxagoras’s theory of matter, to
which we shall come later. ‘And the things mixed in it would have
prevented 1t from controlling anything as it can when alone and by
itself.” Here we have, clearly stated by Anaxagoras himself, what in
the eyes of Aristotle and others was his greatest achievement, namely
the realization that the moving and controlling force must be entirely
separate from the matter which it moves.
‘It is the finest and purest of all things, and has all knowledge of
<p>everything and greatest power.” The epithets used are lepron and
katharon. Lepton is a word commonly used with a material denotation,
applied to finely woven materials, spiders’ webs, finely ground powder
and so forth, and its use here has sometimes been taken as evidence that
Mind is still being thought ofas corporeal.” Since however it is already
  <em> </em>It 1s chie   “thinnest™ of all thungs, so chat it can penetrate everywhere, and it would   be
meaningless to say that the immaterul is <em></em> thinner”” than the macecial’ (Burnet, £GP, 268).

used of counsel or wisdom (pfjTis) in the Jliad, it is hardly worth
repeating the many occasions on which it is used with similar non-
material subjects in classical Greek,”                 If Anaxagoras had at last grasped
the idea of non-material existence, he obviously had not the vocabulary
in which to express it. Even now it is notoriously difficult to speak of
mind or spirit without borrowing the terminology of the material
world. (‘Spirit” itself is an example.) Knowing no positive epithets to
apply to the non-material as such, Anaxagoras could only describe it
pegatively as not being matter. This he seems to do emphatically in
his repeated insistence that it is entirely separate from the mixture of
everything which we should call matter. Mind is that aspect of Anaxi-
mander’s apeiron which ‘steers all things’, tAar aspect of Heraclitus's
fire which deserved the name of Jogos and was wise; but the divine and
ruling faculty of Anaximander’s arcke has been recognized as incom-
patible with its identification with a corporeal mass, the logos of Hera-
clitus has been released from its uncomfortable association with fire.
 This judgment is in no way affected by the use of the epithet epzon.
<p>If it needs to be qualified at all, it must be by the hint [ater in fr. 12 that
there can be ‘greater and lesser’ quantities of Mind, and the statement
infr. 14 that it is “ where all other things are’. It may be that Anaxagoras
thought of Mind as being, though invisible and intangible, extended in
space. Apeiron probably does imply that in order to control the mass,
it had in some way to permeate it, although at the same time keeping
itself separate from the bodies within it. Yet the phrase ‘the greater and
the lesser” is introduced for the purpose of once again contrasting Mind</p>

that since philosophers themselves are at this time only on the threshold of an explicit distinction
berween mind and marter, others can have been conscious of no such distinction and may have
thought of the entitzes just histed as being of the same order as blood or wood. (The gpéves were
of course originally a part of the body.) The point is that they were fully capable of using a word
metaphorically, and were obviously doing so in the cases cited. Homer also speaks of Ugatvew
witriv ({1, 7.324, etc.), but we do not suppose on that account that he thought of 2 pfmis as some-
thing made of wool or stting. P. Leon has some sensible remarks on this point in @, 1927,

Smaller and greater parts of this do differ, for it is not homogeneous
but made up of portions characterized by different physical factors
which in the aggregate are manifest to sense, whereas ‘Mind is ail alike,
in any quantity’.          If any shred of materialism remains, it is very slight
indeed.<em> A Christian who believes that God ‘dwelleth not in temples
made with hands’ will still say that he is ‘everywhere’.
Next we are told that Mind has a special relation 1o the organic
<p>world. ‘Everything that has life’,.fr. 12 continues, ‘both greater and
smaller, all these Mind controls; and it controlled the whole revolution,
to make it revolve in the beginning.” Here is another handle for the
criticism of Plato and Aristotle. We note the different tenscs, Mind
was necessary to start the revolution in the beginning, for another
epoch-making innovation of Anaxagoras was to say explicitly that
everything started from a state of rest into which motion had to be
introduced for the first time. The cosmos is not just a stage in an endless
cyclical process as with Empedocles. Aristotle reports (Phys. 250b24):
‘He says that all things were together and at rest for an infinite time,
then Mind set them in motion and divided them.” Once the initial push
had been administered, the revolution continued of its own momentum
at an ever-increasing speed. The control of Mind over living creatures,
on the other hand, continues still. That life should stand in a specially
close relation to the intelligent cosmic force is a natural assumption
and in line with earlier thought. Living things in fact contain it. This
¢ The difficalty of conceiving anything as existing, in any sense, which was not extended in
<p>space, may be illustrated by a comparison with a later age. Basil Willey writes \n The Seventeenth
Century Background (p. 165): </p>
</p>
</em>Such authority had the notion of <em>“Extension” 1n the seventeenth
century, as the essential attribute of the admittedly “real” (matter), that unless one could atrribute
“extension"” 10 a substance, that substance was in danger of evaporating into nethingness. This
was Henry More’s fear for </em>spirit”; Descartes by affirming spirit as a mere abstraction was
really, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, beginning upon the slippery slope 1owards
materialism and atheism.    It was safer, in More’s opinion, to admit frankly that extension is a
necessary attribute of all that exists, and 1o demonstrate, further, that spirit, 2s a real being, must
he extended also. He was anxious fo claim extension for spirit, “that it may be conceived to be
some real Being and true Substance, and not a vain Figment, such as is everything thar has no
Amplitude and is in no sost extended . (True Notion of a Spirit, p. 41.)&gt; So that matter may still
be differentiated from spirit, More denies that extension is the formal principle of matter, for
which he substitutes impenetrability, Spirit is penetrable, Secondly, extended matter is divisible,
extended spiae ‘indiscerpeible’, Its extension is different from marerial extension. He describes
it as ‘metaphysical extension’, ‘a fourth dimension’, or “essential spissitude .

must be the reference when in fr. 11 Anaxagoras makes an apparent
exception to his rule that material things contain a portion of all other
things except Mind. ‘In some things there is Mind too.” Aristotle
concluded that Anaxagoras did not distinguish between Mind and life
(nous and psyche):<em>
In many places he says that the cause of what is good and right is Mind,</em>
but elsewhere that it is psyche; for he says that Mind is in all that lives, both
great and small, high and humble, whereas Mind in the sense of wisdom does
not appear to be in all animals, or even in all men.
There is then a portion of Mind in living things, ‘contralling’, i.e.
animating them. It still remains distinct from body-substance, and no
inconsistency other than a purely verbal one is involved.
That is practically all our information about Mind. To sum up:
(1) As its name implies, it is conscious and intelligent, and its
<p>knowledge and judgment know no limitations. It is nowhere in the
extant fragments called God, but this may be accidental and it is im-
possible that Anaxagoras should not have thought of it as divine
(Beiov).
(2) It is completely separate from *things’ (xphucre), and entirely
<p>homogeneous and self-consistent (Suowos), whereas the ‘things’ dis-
play an infinite variety. This means that if not imagined as completely
incorporeal, it is very nearly so, and Anaxagoras has adopted every
means at his command to contrast it with the material.
(3) 1t governs itself and is ultimately responsible for all movement
<p>of matter. In particular it introduced rational order and arrangement
(8iedopmoe), which are the outcome of circular motion (eptxdpnots).
(4) Tt retains a special form of control over the organic world, and
<p>seems to be identical with the psyche or animating principle in living
things.
                              (5) Theory of Matter
<p>There is much dispute over what Anaxagoras meant to say in his
account of the nature of matter. The most recent tendency is to claim
that earlier interpreters have been over-subtle and introduced complica-
  ! Dean. qo4bs. Cf. 405213 and p. 316 below.

tions into what was an essentially simple scheme. I fear that any reader
who starts with this impression will be doomed to disillusionment. The
idea that Anaxagoras’s scheme is anything but remarkably subte and
complex could hardly survive a reading of, for example, fr. 3, where he
tells us among other things that ‘ there is always a larger than the large,
and it is numerically equal to the small’. As with the bigger problem
of Heraclitus, I shall attempt a continuous exposition without too many
confusing digressions to take account of opposing views. In this case
it is particularly difficult to do justice to the opinions of othér scholars
by bringing them in piecemeal in the course of a different vejsion, and
anyone who wishes to make up his own mind after an impartial survey
of modern interpretations as well as the ancient evidence\must be
advised to read the others in their entirety.* My debt to them will then
become plain.
Of the ancient evidence the wards of Anaxagoras himself must of
<p>course be given priority, but since the extant quotations amount in all
to little over three average-sized pages of print, they must be supple-
mented at times by a prudent use of his critics and commentators
from Aristotle onwards.              In particular, to judge the meaning of the
fragments properly, it is worth while looking at them in the order
in which Simplicius presents them, and in the context of his own
explanations. This is something to which perhaps sufficient attention
has not been paid in the past, and, at the risk of some repetition,

escapable Eleatic denial that anything comes into being or perishes.
As Aristotle phrased it (Phys. 191a30): ‘Neither does what is come
into being (for it is already) nor could anything come into being out
of what is not.” More than this, it is an attempt to restore as far as
possible the Milesian world. In reading Anaxagoras’s views on the
composition of matter we are constantly reminded of Anaximander or
Anaximenes.! At the same time Anaxagoras seems to have been
impressed not only by Parmenides himself but also by the more para-
doxical arguments of his follower Zeno, for example, that if there were
many things they would be at the same time both small to vanishing
point and infinitely large.?
 When one takes into account also the condition already mentioned,
<p>that every natural substance mustbe asstimed to have existence in the full
Parmenidean sense, it is obvious thata solution of the problem of genesis
is going to call for remarkable ingenuity on the part of Anaxagoras,
and that it will be no simple task to interpret it from his fragmentary
remains. There is however one difficulty which haunted the subject
until recently but which I am sure is imaginary, and has been clearly
shown to be so by A. L. Peck (CQ, 1931, 27f.). We may get this out
of the way first. It is a difficulty which particularly affected Cornford’s
account, ‘and can be best stated in his own words (CQ,                           1930, 14):
The theory rests on two propositions which seem flatly to contradict one
another.    One is the principle of Homoeomererty: A natural substance such
as a piece of gold consists solely of parts which are like the whole and like
one another—every one of them gold and nothing else. The other is: ¢ There
is a portion of everything in everything’, understood to mean that a piece of
gold (or any other substance), so far from containing nothing but gold,
contains portions of every other substance in the world. Unless Anaxagoras
was extremely muddleheaded, he cannot have propounded a theory which
simply consists of this contradiction.</p>
</p>
</p>
* This is well brought out in Gigon’s article in Philologus, 1936~7.
* Zeno, fir. 3 and 2; see p. 89 above. The reaction of Anaxagoras to Zeno has been emphas-
<p>ized in particular by Gigon, oc. cit., Raven, CQ, 1954 and KR, 370-2. So far as chronology goes,
the relationship might have been reversed, for the two were contemporaries, and some have
 supposed that Zeno was atacking Anaxagoras. See the discussion in Luria, Qu. und Stud. 1932,

<p>                                          Anaxagoras
Now Anaxagoras certainly said ‘ There is a portion of everything in
<p>everything’. We have it in his own words (¢v mevi mawTés poipa
tveoTv) repeated more than once (frr. 11, 12) and restated in different
terms elsewhere. This then is a principle which any explanation of his
theory must take into account.                   On the other hand there is no good
reason at all to suppose that he held any ‘ principle of homoeomereity*,
in the sense that a natural substance ‘ consists solely of parts which are
like the whole and like one another’.                        No fragment says this, it is
inconsistent with what the fragments do say, and moreo fr it is not
 difficult to see how the mistake arose.                     ]
 It arose because Aristotle says that Anaxagoras ‘makes the somoio-
<p>meré [homoeomers, “things of like parts”] elements’.” He goes on
immediately, however, to exemplify what he means by the word:
‘Anaxagoras makes the homoeomers elements, such as bone, flesh,
marrow, and whatever else has parts synonymous with the whole’, and
a few lines later, contrasting him with Empedocles, ‘Anaxagoras on the
other hand says that it is the homoeomers that are simple and elemental,
and earth, fire, water and air are compounds, being in fact a collection
of seeds of the others’.&gt; Again at De caelo, 302228
Anaxagoras        is   opposed     to Empedocles         on the subject of the elements.
Empedocles’s view is that fire and earth and the other substances of the same
arder are the elements of bodies, and everything is composed of them.
According to Anaxagoras, on the other hand, the homoeomers are elements
(flesh, bone and other substances of that order), whereas air and fire are a
mixture of these and all the other seeds, for each consists of an agglomeration
of all the homoeomers in invisible quantities.</p>
</p>
</p>
Now it is unlikely that Anaxagoras used the word somoiomeré 3 and
<p>there is no reason to think that Aristotle intends in these passages to
saddle him with any doctrine that however far one divides any of his

<p>                          Matter: Aristorle’s Interpreration
elements the parts will always be like the whole. We may in the end
find that there is a sense in which that is true, but we are under no
obligation to look on it from the beginning as a condition that must be
satisfied. All that Aristotle is doing is to indicate what sort of sub-
stances Anaxagoras regarded as elemental, and this he can do most
simply by saying that they are the substances which ke Aimself calls
homoeomerous; and to remove any shadow of doubt he addsexamples—
flesh, bope, marrow, etc.
In Aristotle’s scheme, matter exists at four main levels of complexity.
<p>At the most fully developed level are complete living creatures, plants,
animals and men. These are made up of features and organs—eyes,
noses, hands, hearts, livers, fruits—which Aristotle calls non-homoeo-
merous because they cannot be broken up into things of the same
name: a hearr does not divide into small hearts, and so on. These
in their turn are composed of homoeomerous substances, defined as
those ‘ of which the part is identical in name and nature with the whole</p>
</p>
</em>.?
They include animal bone and tissues, woaod, bark, sap and other plant
tissues, ores, metals and stones, and in their turn are compounds of the
four elements or simple bodies, carth, water, air and fire.&gt; With them
we reach the simplest corporeal entities, rthough even these are con-
ceptually divisible further into matter and form.3
It follows that for Aristotle what he calls homoeomers-—flesh, bone,
<p>hair, etc.—are not elemental, and to bring out the peculiarity of Anaxa-
goras’s doctrine he says that for him these are elements. He is ‘using the
term as a convenient one of his own (and therefore readily intelligible
to his listeners) to denote the substances it regularly denotes in his own
philosophy. Nothing further need be assumed.” (Peck, loc. cir. 28f.)
  <em> &amp;y tcbore owdwugos T8 kpos ke, GC, 314a20. awwdwukoy, as distinet from Sudwugav,

</em> The most complete list of duorouspfi is at Meteor. 388a138., where also are mentioned the

homoeomerous (Metaph. 992a7, Top. 135324-06), but not when Aristorle is attending smictly

sbuoTa owliryara. It js to animal and vegetable tissues that the word is more especially applied.
  3 The formal aspect of the simple bodies is provided for Aristotle by the contrary qualities
hat, cold, wet and dry.    Each element is characterized by 2 pair of these.   (G.C. bk. 2, ch. 1,
320224fF, and ch, 3.)
  ! This comes aut especially clearly at Cael. 302b11fl., where he argues that Anaxagoras was

<p>                                        Anaxagoras
In order to conform to both his principles, that () there is a portion
<p>of everything in everything but (8) everything is infinitely divisible
into parts homogeneous with itself, Cornford adopted in essence the
explanation of Tannery which Burnet had also approved. In certain
passages of Anaxagoras there is mention of what we, following Aris-
totle, call the opposites: the hot and the cold, the wet and the dry, the
dense and the rare and so on, ‘Opposites’ is a neutral word which does
not prejudge the question of whether they are qualities or material
substances possessing the qualities. Tannery was undO}lbtedIy ana-
chronistic in assuming that “the hot” and ‘the cold” were, qualities for
Anaxagoras in precisely the sense in which heat and cdldness were
understood in his own time. Alive to this danger, Cornford.called them
¢ quality-things’ (Joc. cit. 87), on the supposition that, since the notions of
substance and quality were not yet clearly distinguished, they partook of
the nature of both.<em> The solution proposed was that in the sentence
“there is a portion of everything in everything’, the “things’ or ‘ factors™
referred to in the neuter expression mavtés (‘of everything”) are these
opposites. The statement would then mean, not that in all gold there
is a portion of everything else—Hfesh, hais, vood, ete.—but {10 use more
modern terminology) that everything must have a certain temperature,
some degree of moisture or dryness, some resistance and some colour.
As to this, one can only agree with Raven3 that it is impossible that

</em> Cyrit Barley had some excuse for saying in a private Jetter to Cornford, <em>1 still don’t under-
stand what you mean by a “quality-thing™." His comments are of some interest: </em>You say
P. 93...that “these quality-things exist only in the seeds”, But what does this really mean? If
it means “qualities” 1 could agree, but you show admirably, what 1 have always thought, that
that is not a possible conception for Anaxagoras. What then is your hot quahiey-thing? You say
on p. 84 a “thing whose nature consists enurely in the single property of hoeness™. Is it con-
crete? Then it must be a hoe piece of matter. And if so, {a) yau must come dawn to 1 by infinge
division, you must some tume be able " to separate hot and cold with a hatcher” [fr. 8: Lhope 1o
show thar this would not necessarily be so for Anaxagoras), or (8) it must have other attributes as
well. If it’s not concrete, then it's 2 quality.’
* Nowhere so much as 1 an exposition of Anaxagoras does one envy the Greek its neat and
<p>easy use of the neuter plural adjective without noun, As it is, readers will have to put up with
frequent repetition of the clumsy and characterless English word “things’, for which the Hellen-
1t5 among, them will, § hope, make allowances.
  3 And with Bailey, who before Raven had written in the letter previously quoted: I do find
it awfully difficult to believe that this really means “in every simple natural substance there is a
portion of all the pairs of opposites™. Ac least it is a very odd way of saying it. I find it equally
difficult 1o get over the strong tradition (in Lucretius and elsewhere) that it was by means of this
saying that Anaxagoras undertook to explam the phenomenon of change. I can’t think they can
have been so wrong as to the context in which it occurred.’</p>

anyone should have written the simple sentence &amp;v owTi TavTds uoTpa
#veomww (“there is a portion of everything in everything®) and meant
by movréds something quite different from Tewti, Moreover the idea
that the first ‘everything’ meant every natural substance and the second
one meant every ‘opposite’ was only introduced to save the principle
of homoeomereity by allowing every substance to be infinitely divisible
into parts of that substance only, and I hope it has been made clear that
such a principle in Apaxagoras is no more than a ghost which may now
be considered laid.
I suggest (or rather I am convinced) that for Anaxagoras there was
<p>no difference in the mode of their being between the opposites (so~
called, but not by him as far as we know) and other substances like
flesh and gold. Taking a first glance at fr. 4, we find him speaking of
‘the mixture of all things (xpAnara), the wet, the dry, the hot, the cold,
the bright, the dark, since there was much earth in it and an infinite
number of seeds’. Evidently all these alike are for him tAings, com-
ponents of the mixture. In fr. 3 he says that of the small there is no
smallest and that there is always a larger than the large. No difficulty
has ever been felt abour the meaning of ‘the small” and ‘the large’
here: everyone assumes without question that they mean small and
large things, or particles of matter, for it is in fact obvious that in the
context they could not mean anything else. Why then should we sup-
pose that when Anaxagoras speaks of “the hot” and “the cold” he means
something of a different order of being, not hot or cold substances but
‘quality-things’? Aristotle bears out our contention when in contrast-
ing Empedocles and Anaxagoras he says (Phys. 187az0) that they both
make a world by separation from amixture, but whereas for Empedocles
it contains the four elements only, for Anaxagoras it includes ‘the
homoeormers and the opposites’. A little later (187h4), explaining that
the process of separation is never complete, he says: ‘Nothing is
purely and wholly white or black or sweet or flesh or bone’, as if it were
quite natural, in speaking of Anaxagoras, 1o put white and black, flesh
and bone in the same category.
This combination of Aristotle’s phraseology with the actual frag-
<p>ments seems conclusive, and 1 shall assume that for Anaxagoras the hot,
the cold, the wet, the bright, the black, etc., were substances having
                                 285
<p>                                          Anaxagoras
these characteristics, substances on the same footing as flesh and bone,
just as the small and the large obviously are in fr. 3.7
 Anaxagoras’s general line of thought was this: nothing can come out
<p>of nothing, yet everything appears to be generated out of everything
else; therefore everything must contain everything else. ‘How’, he
asks (fr. 10), <em> could hair come from what is not hair, or flesh from what
is not flesh?’
 Aristotle puts his argument thus (Phys. 187a32):
<p>If everything which comes to be is generated either from existiné things or
from the non-existent, and the latter is impossible, . . . they [i.e. Anaxagoras
and those who think like him] supposed the other alternative to be hecessary,
namely that things come into being from things that exist and afe already
present, but owing to their minute size are imperceptible to us. For that
reason they say that everything is mixed in everything, i.e. because
they saw everything coming into being out of everything; but things
look different, and are called by different names, according to that
which predominates numerically in the mixture of an infinite number
of constituents. Nothing is purely and wholly white or black or sweet
or flesh or bone, but the nature of each thing appears to be that of
which it coniains most. [The last words are a faithful paraphrase of the end
of fr. 12.]</p>

<p>a passage which Burnet (EGP, 328) and Diller (Hermes, 1941, 363) suppose with good reason
o be directed against Anaaagoras. F. M. Cleve, The Phdosophy of Anaxagoras, 7, notes that
when Anaxagoras wants an abstract word to descnbe a quality he has it 1o hand: cof. Teuris in
{r. 9. Addmonal evidence that Anaxagoras put all these in the same category is provided by the
scholiast on Gregory Nazianzen who quotes fr. 10.          Since he describes Anaxagoras airily as
“talking nonsense’, he is not perhaps the most reliable of witnesses, but ic looks as if at thus point
he is doing his best to paraphrase something that Anaxagaras actually said. He gives fr. 10 in the
following context: <em>He talked nonsense about all things being mixed with each other, and be-
coming separated as they grow. In the same germ (you) there are hair, nails, veins, arteries,
sinews, bones, which happen to be invisible because they are in such small parts but are divided
as they grow. “For how”, he says, </em>could hair come from what is not hair and flesh from what
is not flesh?” This he asserts not only of bodies but also of colours: the black is 1n the white and
the white 1 the black; and he made the same assumption abowt weights, supposing the light to be
mixed with the heavy and vice versa.”
Viastos approves Cornford’s *quality-things’, but says that “powers’ is a better word still for
<p>hot, cold, ecc. <em>The current term for “qualiy” was dynamis, powes' (Philas. Rev., 1950, 4t£).
But in the passage of M       to which he refers, they are referred to not as being, bur as Aaving
powers (ravrolas Suvégnas Exovra).

</em> Cf. the scholiast on Gregory Nazianzen quoted in previous note, It is presumably the same
point that Aaaxagoras put in the form of a paradox when he said that snow is black because it is
frozen warer and water is black, (Sext. Pyrrh. Hyp. 1.33, 497.) Though it appears white 10 the
eye, some portions of the black must have remained in jt.</p>

<p>                     A Portion of Everything in Everything
This idea of Anaxagoras is most clearly exemplified in our own growth
<p>and nutritionand thatof plants.’ Wemay eatnothing but bread and veget-
ables, and these apparently turn into flesh and boneand all the other con-
stituents of our bodies. Since then on Parmenidean principles no new
thing can come into existence, these constituents must have pre-existed in
the corn or leaves, only in quantities too minute 1o be discerned. ‘Anaxa-
goras plausibly says that flesh from the food is added to our flesh’
(Arist. G4, 723a10). Cornford objected that in fact everything does
not turn into everything else; if it did, we could be nourished by copper
or cork. This was one of his reasons for supposing that ‘a portion of
everything in everything” does not mean what it plainly says. Ta explain
the changes that can actually be observed to oceur, it is only necessary
ta suppose that some things are in some things.<em> Nevertheless, Anaxa-
goras did say ‘there is a portion of everything in everything’, and if
this is to be given its natural meaning, some explanation must be sought.
It can be found in a statement attributed to Anaxagoras (though not in
an actual extant fragment) that the change may be mediate and not
direct. Simplicius’s statement of the theory (in his comment on the
passage of Aristotle’s Physics just quoted, 460.8) is this:
Aristotle shows that Anaxagoras had not only 10 call the whole mixture
infinite in size, but also to speak of each homoeomer as having everything in
it just like the whole. They are not only infinite but infinite times infinire.
[This is confiemed by fr. 6.] To this view Anaxagoras was brought by his
belief that (e) nothing comes to be our of the non-existenr, and (4) every-
thing is nourished by its like. He saw (a) that everything comes to be onr of
everything, if not directlv then serially3 (as air from fire, water from air, earth
from water, stone from earth, and fire again from stone), and (4) thar by
taking in the same food, e.g. bread, a great variety of things is brought into
being—flesh, bones, veins, sinews, hair, nails, feathers also and horns in
certain cases—-and hke is nourished by like; wherefore he supposed that

Plato, Phaedo, 96d is also a clear reference 1o Anaxagoras.
* Cornford, foc. cir. 19-11. Asan explananon of nutrition, the theory of ‘everything in every-
<p>thing’ seemed to him uneconomic. It 15 an axiom of saience that the more economic hypothesis

<p>these things are in the food.          Similarly, assuming water ta be the nourish-
ment of teees, water contains wood, bark, leaves and fruit.                    Hence he said
that everything is mixed in everything and coming-to-be takes place by
separation.
Elsewhere (162.31), afier repeating the premise that nothingcan come
from nothing, he goes on:
Therefore in the homoeomerous mass? there are flesh, bone, blood, gold,
lead, sweet and white, but in quantities 100 small 1o be perceived                   by us, all
being in all. For how could everything be seen to be generated from every-
thing (even if through other intermediaries)* if everything was not in every-
thing?
To say that carth is generated from fire sounds as absurd s to say
<p>that flesh comes from gold. But it is perfectly possible to believe that
fire turns to vapour, vapour condenses into water, and water (as
Avaximenes held) into earth and stones. Similarly, Anaxagoras can have
thought, gold cannot turn directly into flesh, but it may be subject to a
series of transformations, at the other end of which is an edible plant
which does contain enough portions of flesh, etc., to nourish the body.</p>
</p>
 What then in detail was Anaxagoras’s view? Let us take first the
<p>state of things as they now are, and afterwards the process by which
they reached it, that is, the cosmogony.
In fr. 4, which Simplicius informs us came soon after the beginning
<p>of the first book On Nature, he writes:
This being 5o, we must suppose that there are many things of all kinds in all
the things that are being mingled, and seeds of all things with every sort of
shapes and colours and flavours.

                          Principle of Infinite Divisibility
but everything has a postion of everything, When it is impossible for there
to be a smallest, nothing can become separated or by itself, but just as in
the beginning sa now all things are together. Everything contains many
1hings, the larger and she smaller containing an equal number of the things
that are being separated off.
   The phrase TouA&xoTov uf ZaTw eluen (It is impossible for there
to be        <anything which can be called> the smallest’) implies that a
piece of matter is, in theory if not in practice, infinitely divisible into
ever smaller pieces, and this principle of infinite divisibility? is stated
more fully in fr. 3:
Of the small there is no smallest, but always a smaller (for what is cannot
not-be);? but similarly there is always a larger than the large, and it is
numerically equal to the small, whereas in relation to itself each thing is both
Jarge and small.
The last clause means that each thing in and by itself (rpos éoutd, in
camparison wich itself rather than with anything else) may be regarded
as both great (because composed of an infinite number of parts or
ngredients) and small (because its parts are themselves infinitesimally
small).3
It is here that Anaxagoras seems to take up the challenge of Zeno,
<p>who thought he could reduce the notion of plurality to absurdity by
saying that if things were many they would have to be at the same time
infinitely great and so small as to have no magnitudeatall. Anaxagoras’s
reply shows an understanding of the meaning of infinity which no
Greek before him had attained: things are indeed infinite in quantity
and at the same time infinitely small (&amp;wretpo kai mATiBos kad oukpdTNTA,
fr. 1), but they can go on becoming smaller to infinity without thereby
becoming mere points without magnitude. Another argument against
plurality was thar its separate components must be both infinite in
number (because between any two of them there must always be some-

thing else, if they are two and therefore separate), and finite because
‘they must be neither more nor less than they are’. This contention
Anaxagoras simply denies (fr. ): ‘Now that these things have been
separated, it must be recognized that all things are neither less nor more
(for there cannot be more than all), but all are equal.” Even an infinite
number is no more and no less than it is. The polemical echoes of
Zeno are unmistakable.!
We can have no doubt by now of the subtlety and originality of
<p>Anaxagoras’s thought. He has not only grasped the notion of strict
infinity (and in particular of the infinitely small),<em> but, having realized
what it implies, accepts the consequences as few Greeks were willing to
do. For jnstance if a body contains an infinite number of ingredients,
then however far it may be divided up, each successively smaller por-
tion will still contain an infinite pumber of ingredients; and so, as
Simplicius said, things are “not only infinite but infinite times infinite’.3
Thus the statement that there is no smallest and no largest is logically
connected with the statement that there is an equal number of portions
in the large and the small.
Here however we must take info account something which may not
<p>seem easy to reconcile with the points already made,</p>
</em> but which we
must accept as credible to Anaxagoras and indeed the essential con-
dition for the genesis of a cosmos.                 Everything contains a portion of
  <em> Zeno, fer. 1-3, pp. 89 . above. The companison is made by Gigon, Philologus, 1936-7,
4, and Raven, CQ, 1954, 125 fl. Anaxagoras ‘apphes to physical matter the arguments that had
carlier been employed by Zena i comnexion wath mathematical magnitude”.

</em> This is lucidly expressed by Vlastos, Philos. Rev. 1950, 4x. (Thecriticism of him byC. Strang:
in Archiv, 1963, does not seem 10 me o be cogent.) That Anaxagoras did grasp the imphcations of
the infinntely small emerges also from the criticism of Aristotle, 10 whom the idea of infinity,
except as a purely logical concept, Was anathema. At Phys. 187b30 he thinks to face Anaxagoras
with a dilemma: ‘If the process of separation ever comes to an end, everything will not be in
everything, for [se. from an original mixture containing water and flesh] in the remaining water
there will be no flesh; if on the other hand it does not, but it is always possible 1o take away
something further, there must be in ¢ finite rnagnitude an infinite number of equal finite parts.
This Is impossible.” Except for the word “equal’, which is an unwarranted addition of Aristotle,
the second alrernative represents Anaxagoras’s view and was not to his mind impossible at all.

everything else, and a large piece of something contains as many por-
tions as a small piece of it, though they differ in size; but every sub-
stance does nar contain all the infinite number of substances in equal
proportions. So he says at the end of fr. 12: <em>Mind is all alike, both the
greater and the smaller. But apart from Mind, nothing is like anything
else, but those things are and were most plainly each thing, of which
there are most in it.”
This passage could be the source of Aristotle’s true remark that
<p>‘things come into being from things that exist and are present, but owing
to their minute size are imperceptible to us’ (Phys. 187236). We must
suppose that what we call a piece of bone contains portions of all the
infinite variety of substances, but that the portions of bane predominate
and most of the rest are present only in imperceptible quantities. 1say
most of the rest, because we also call it hard, white and brittle, and in
Anaxagoras’s language 1 believe this would mean that it also contains
predominating quantities of the hard, the white and the brittle.”
This would be more difficolt to understand and accept if we supposed
<p>that there is even a theoretical possibility of the portions of any one
substance      ever existing        separately        from   the rest.       But the infinite
divisibility of matter makes this impossible. As he says himself in fr. 6:
‘When it is impossible for there to be a smallest, nothing can become
separated or by itself, but just as in the beginning, so now all things are
together.” Again in fr. 8, where he gives the opposites as examples:</p>
</p>
</em>The things in the one world-order are not separated from one another
nor cut off with an axe, neither the hot fram the cold nar the cold from
the hot.” Here is another rather difficult bur not impossible idea which
  <em> Vlastos objects (Philos. Rev. 1950, 52£.) that this would make the bone-portions redundant.
Taking flesh as his example, he writes: “Flesh has any number of qualities: it is red, soft, heavy,
ere. Given these powers in the required ratio, the result would e flesh. Why then need we mix
flesh-seeds (or any other seeds) zo [sic: the italics are Viastos’s] these powers to produce flesh?”
([ am not concerned ar the moment with the rightness of using the ward “seeds' in this cannexion.)
The tempration is irresistible to put beside this the words of William Whewell in the nineteepth
century: ‘An apple which is red, and round, and hard, is not merely redness and roundness and
hardness; these circumstances may all alter while the apple remains the same apple.’ (Philos. of
¢he Indactive Sciences, 2nd ed., vol. 1, 405.) Whewell was of course arguing in favour of the dis-
tinction between quality and substance, bat even befure Aristotle had made          that distinction
explicit, it might seem to a philosopher on somewhat similar grounds that bone or flesh must
concain ‘hoaneness’ ot ‘fleshaess' as well as hardess or softness, redness or whiteness: that 55, 1n
Apaxagoras’s more concrete tes ms, bove or flesh as well as the hard and the white, the red and the
soft, ete. This may not appear a tenable point of view to ourselves, but thatis a different matier.

<p>                                         Anaxagoras
Anaxagoras asks us to assimilate: the manifold world has evolved by a
process of separation or division (&amp;méKpiots, Sidkpuais) from an
original mixture of all things, yet in spite of the separation that has
taken place, everything still contains some of everything else: ‘as in
the beginning, so now all things are together.”
Here an account of Anaxagoras’s views on the constitution of matter
<p>may well stop. Ever since Aristotle expositors have taken it further by
asking themselves the question: </p>
</p>
</em> What for Anaxagoras are the elements
or first principles (&amp;pyai or oToryela) "2 In so far as this question admits
ofananswer, it must be that which Aristotle gives, namely the ‘homoeo-
mers’ flesh, bone, hair, sinew, wood, bark, gold, iron, etc.? But there
is no evidence in the remains of Anaxagoras’s own writings of any
word for elements or principles, and it is possible that by introducing
them we should be distorting his thought and purtting questions that
he did not ask.          In what sense can one speak of elements in a &amp;poG
TévTa, an ‘all things together’; which exists now asin the beginning?
Aristotle at least was led into confusion by thinking in this way. One
thing that has emerged with certainty from our examination is that for
Anaxagoras there is no such thing as a simple body, and for Aristotle</p>
! Vlastos (Philos. Rev. 1950, 125£.) quotes with approval the following from Cleve’s book on
<p>Anaxagoras (87£): ‘From his presuppositions Anaxagoras must have concluded that in bread
and the other victuals seemingly dissimilar 1he same had 10 be contained as was contained in fesh,
wn hlood, in bane, ete. This, however, did oot mean that the ones consisted of the athers, bat that
hath consisted of the same chirdsi—namely, of those ultumate elements: rare- and dense-moiras,
bright- and dark-morras, warm- and cold-raoiras, motst- and dry-moiras, etc.’ (I have italicized
the words that seem to me open to criticism.) Vlastos adds: <em>In other words, flesh, constituted of
the various qualitative ingredients in a given ratio, contains bone, hair, etc., not (as Lucret;us and
other commentatoss, ancient and modern, bave imagined) in the form of discrete particles, but
simply through the fact that its own ingred:eats, being the same as those of hone, hair, ar any
other substance, need only be taken in the rano appropriate to bone or hair to “generate” bone
or hair.”
It is a little rash to dismiss not only Lucretius but “other commentatats, ancient and modern’;
<p>and in fact it is nor ‘rare- and dense-moiras, eic.’, as distinct from bone, hair, etc., that are the
ultimate elements. Aristotte and Simplicius puc it beyond doubt that the Ariscacelian homoeomers
(bone, hair, etc)) are themselves ultimate. Aristotle several times says that these are aToixeix in
the sense in which Empedocles’s prgducra were, and Simplicius (who made his own study of the
text) says for example at Phys. 167.9, &amp; Tév ToiolTe 5t Srotopepiv atyKerTan Té 350 Karl £l ToTTE

1t could alsa be misleading to say that ancient commentators “imagine’ the homoeomers 10 be
<p>m the form of discre:e parucles.     Aristotle and Simplicius clearly understood the caputal and
essential poiat made by Anaxagoras in fr. 12, that ‘no one thing is completely separated off ot
divided from another save Mind .

<p>                             Question of the Elements
it is axiomatic that an element must be simple.                       &amp;TA&amp; odmare and
oTotygin are synonymous, In one place this betrays him into calling
Anaxagoras’s ‘elements’ simple, an easy slip when he is contrasting
him with Empedocles. In the view of Empedocles, he says (GC, 3142
26), fite, water, air and earth are clemental and simple rather than
‘flesh, bone and such homoeomers; but Anaxagoras and his followers
call the latter simple and elemental (&amp;mA&amp; o ororxeic) and earth, fire,
water and air compounds of them’. When however in De caelo (3022
28) he repeats the contrast with Empedocles in slightly different words,
he omits ‘simple’ and calls them elements only; and a litde later
(302b14) he is accusing Anaxagoras of inconsistency in that he calls all
homoeomers elements, whereas not all homoeomers are simple. Else-
where too he shows his awareness that the ‘homoeomers’ are not
simple for Anaxagoras, for example at Phys. 187b4 (p. 285 above),
where he paraphrases the end of fr. 12. So also Simplicius, quoting or
paraphrasing Theophrastus, wrote:*
Of thase who posited principles infinite in number, some called them simple
and homogeneous, others compound and heterogeneous and contrasted, but
designated by thar which prevails; for Anaxagoras. . .claimed thai all the
homoeomers, such as water or fire or gold,? are ungenerated and indestruc~
tible, and that it is combination and division alone which give them the appear-
ance of generation and perishing, for everything is in everything, but each is
designated by that which prevails in it.</p>
</p>
</p>
My final suggestion is therefore that Anaxagoras did not put the
<p>question of the nature of marter in its Aristotelian form: ‘ What are the
elements of physical bodies?” He asked rather: On what hypothesis of
the nature of matter can one explain the apparent change of one sub-</p>

  <em> The inclusion of twa of the Empedaclean aad Aristatelian elements, water and fice, among
the homoeomers is probably due te a misunderstanding of Anst. Meraph. 984313, from which

forbidden by the law of Parmenides?® And he answered in effect that
none of the popularly recognized forms of physical substance was prior

there already existed portions of all the others, though in quanrities
beneath the level of our perception. This answer was made possible by
the conception of the infinitely small, a conception which had been put
into his head by a reading of Zeno, though Zeno had only mentioned
it in order to dismiss it as absurd.</p>
                         (6) The initial state: cosmogony
<p>How      then, and from what, did the cosmos originate?                             Anaxagoras
opened his treatise with a description of the original state of matter,
and the quotations from this early part of his work are best seen in the
setting in which Simplicius has handed them down (Phys. 155.23):
Anaxagoras’s view that homoeomers infinite in number become separated
off from a single mixture—all things being in everything but each one
characterized by that which predominates—he makes clear by what he says
at the beginning of the first book of his Physics (fr. 1): ‘Al things were
together, infinite both in number and in smallness; for indeed the small was
infinite. And when all things were together, none was discernible because
of their smallness, for aer and aither embraced all things,<em> both of them being
infinite; for these are the greatest in the collection of all things, both in
number and in size.           A little later he says (fr. 2): “der and aither become
separated off from the mass surrounding, and the surrounding is infinite in
number.” And a hle farer (fr. 4): </em> This being so, we must suppose that there
are many things of all kinds in alf the things thatare being mingled, and seeds
of all things with every sort of shapes and colours and flavours. Before they
were separated,” he says,<em> “since all things were together not even any eolonr

<p>                    Beginning of the Process of Separation
could be discerned. That was prevented by the mixmre of all things—the
wet and the dry, the hot and the cold, the bright and the dark, since there
was much earth® in it and an infinite number of seeds® in no way resembling
each other; for not even any of the other things resemble each other.’
The sentence ‘aer and aither embraced (or contained, or concealed)
<p>all things’3 does not mean that aer and aither were already separated in
the original mixture of all things together, though they were, as fr. 2
tells us, the first to become distinet once the process of separation had
begun. As we have seen, one of the most striking things about
Anaxagoras in Aristotle’s view was his diametrical opposition to
Empedocles on the subject of elements. Empedocles said earth, water,
air and fire were primary and all other bodies such as flesh and bone the
result of their mixture, whereas in Anaxagoras’s scheme they themselves
were a mixture of the homoeomers in invisible quantities (De caelo,
302b1). Now eer and aither or fire were in the beginning the two
extreme states of matter, ger containing what is predominantly dense,
cold, wet and dark, and aizker what is predominantly rare, hot, dry and
bright4 In the beginning all these and other contraries were together,
and the best way that Anaxagaras can think of to describe this condition
in which none of them was distinct is to say that ger-and-aither to-
gether held the field.5 When the cosmogonic revolution statts, they are
the first 10 be separated off (fr. 2). This is described also in terms of
their contrasting qualities in fr. 15: ‘“The dense, wet, cold and dark
collected here where they are now,5 and the rare, hot and dry receded
to the further region of the aither.

    The original undifferentiated mass was motionless,                               ‘He starts his
cosmogony from immobility.”* The motion introduced by Mind
was the rotation (mreprydpnois) which still continues, as the wheeling
of the heavenly bodies shows.                      We have Anaxagoras's own words
(fr. 12):
Mind controlled the whole rotation so that it started to rotate in the beginning.
It first began to rotate in a small part, but now it rotates over a larger field
and will include a larger one still.. . . And all things that werg to be, all that
were but are not now, all that are now or shall be, Mind arrahged them all,
including this rotation in which now move the stars, sun and ‘moon, air and
fire that are being separated off. Dense is separated from rare, hot from cold,
bright from dark, dry from wet.                   But there are many portipns of many
things, and no one thing is completely separated or divided from another
except Mind.
    The last sentence should need no comment after our examination of
the structure of matter. The notion that the rotating cosmos was at
first small, and is continually growing by drawing in more of the infinite
surrounding it, is interesting, particularly in the light of some recent
cosmogonical theory. The only clear ancient parallel is the way that
the Pythagorean casmos grew from a seed by drawing in the infinite
in its various forms of breath, time and vaid.? Even in this, so far as
our evidence goes, there is no suggestion that the cosmos is still grow-
ing. The notion of the universe as an organic growth was shared by
Anaximander,3 but again there is no suggestion from his remains that
it is gradually growing in size. However, our information about
Anaximander is regrettably scanty, and, in view of the other parallels
between his cosmogony and that of Anaxagoras, it seems possible that
he entertained a similar idea.
    Fr. 13 (p. 274 above) also speaks of Mind initiating the movement,

and says that everything which Mind moved tended to separate, and
that the rotation hastened the pracess of separation; and fr. 9 remarks
on the tremendous speed of the rotation, many times greater than the
speed of anything on earth.
   We have seen that a portion of any substance, of whatever size,
contains portions of any other substance, though not in equal propor-
tions. In bone, the proportion of bone exceeds thar of other substances
and so gives it its perceptible character as bone. This proportion would
be maintained however small a speck of bone we imagine, even far
below the level of perception, for *the large and the small have portions
equal in number’ (fr. 6 iniz.).
    Now in the original, static mixture it would seem most natural (at
least, for I must be personal here, it would seem so to me) to suppose
that the fusion of everything was thorough and complete, so that no
one thing prevailed over any other in any part of it. Since in origin
the process is not merely mechanical but an ordering controlled by
Mind, the first step could be for portions of each substance to coagulate
and form microscopic specks in which they predominated over the
others, and out of which pieces of bore, flesh, etc., could be amassed
in perceptible quantities as like continued to seek its like in the cosmic
whitl. This however is not what the texts say. Nort only does Anaxa-
goras insist that ‘just as in the beginning, so now all things are together’
(fr. 6), but he also says unequivocally in fr. 4 that in the original ‘all-
things-together’, before separation began, when not even any colour
was discernible, there were not only the opposites and a lot of earth,
but also ‘an infinite number of seeds iz 20 way resembling each other’.
This is exactly the state of things now, when, as he says at the beginning
of the same fragment, all compounds contain seeds of all things with
every kind of shapes, colours and flavours’.
   The original state of matter, then, was a mixmre complete to this
extent, that t0 an imaginary observer it would have appeared uniform,
just as would the apeiron of Anaximander before the opposites were
separated out from it. But Anaxagoras is writing under the stern eye
of Parmenides. He knows that because plurality can never be produced
out of strict unity, this apparently uniform matter must in fact be a
mixture of everything that is subsequently to be produced. Its unity
                                    297
                                         Anaxagoras
must be only in the eye of the beholder—and, like Empedacles, he
emphasized the inadequacy of the senses, saying that ‘ through their
weakness we cannot judge the truth’;" therefore (one may suppase
hum ta have argued) the distinctions which we now perceive between
substances must have been there from the beginning, only in
measures too fine for our coarser faculties 10 pick up. And this
led him to the original and, it may well be thought, remarkably mature

   The mentions of ‘seeds’ by Anaxagoras in fr. 4 have arrracted much
attention and led to much dispute3 He says there, first, that in the
present world everything contains ‘seeds of all things with every sort
of shapes and colours and flavours’, and secondly, that before the cosmic
separation began, the original mixture contained the opposites, much
earth, and ‘seeds infinite in number’.                   In addition, Aristotle says (De
caelo, 302b1) that according to Anaxagoras air and fire are a mixture

   * 1 have avoided here the later and convenient phrase “infinite divisibiliry’ (cf. Lucretius's
neque corpotibus finem esse secandis, 1.844) because the notion of infinite divisibilicy has troubled
some critics as involving a vicious regress. As it presented itself to Anaxagoras, it would certainly
pot have rroubled him. The infinity of ingredients i the same unequal proportions in any portion
of marter, however small, is the cornerstone of hus cosmogony,        for it ensures that even in the
ocgmal fusion, however large or small a poruon be taken, tiere is the lack of homogeneity which
makes poss:ble the Jater emergence of distinctions in percepuble bulk. The acceptabihity of the
infinite regress (:f one likes to call ir that) is the great discovery which enables him to parry, and
even destroy, \he weapons of Zeno. Raven also (KR, 378) defends Anaxagoras on this point,
but 3t could be rmisfeading 10 say as he does that the nfinste regress *must be at least momentanly
halted” if a sensible world 15 to be bulc up. Anaxagaras describes a state, not a process. Gigan's
observation is helpful (Phifologus, 19367, 17), that to speak of infinite divisibility (a specificalty
mathematical problem) is to look back at Anaxagoras fram Aristotle, whereas he himself was
starting from Parmenides and Zeno,

everything 1n this section. His statements that in Emgedocles the elements are exempt from

are incompatible, are at first sight puzzling. It 1s of course solely hecause the elements (the only
6v1a) undergo mixture that according to Empedocles the sensible world can be accounted for.
Viastos's meaning 15 (a5 he has explained to me) that chiere is no radical, ‘chesmical’ fusion of
one element with another biut only juxtaposition of minute parts of each (the view taken in ch.
111, § ¥ of the present work). The somewhat difficult sentence (p. 37,n. 29): “mortahty and mixture

I understand, that although the elements do sy 10 fosm perishable compounds, the terms
‘muxture” and ‘morwl’ cannat dpply 1o an element per si.

of homoeamers like flesh and bone ‘and all the other seeds’, and to
express the same idea elsewhere calls them a panspermia, or aggregation
of seeds, of the homoeomers.
   Viastos has rightly emphasized that in thus enlarging the scope of
the word ‘seed’ beyond the organic sphere Anaxagoras must have had
the biological analogy in mind. It may well have been more than an
analogy, for the notion that the whole world and everything in it was
organic fong outlived the transition from mythological                             to rational
thought and is discernible in Anaximander,’ a predecessor for whom
Anaxagoras had especial regard. The contemporary scientific view of a
seed,? as seen in philosophers and medical writers, Vlastos describes as
follows (foc. cit. 34):
A seed is a campound of all the essential constituents of the parent body
from which it comes [the *pangenesis’ theory] and of the new organism
into which it will grow [the ‘pre-formation’ theory]. In its ovular or uterine
environment (or, in the case of vegetable seeds, in the earth) the compound
grows on the principle of ‘like to like’, each ingredient of the seed being
 ‘nourished” by bits of the same stuff supplied by its environment. That this
is Anaxagoras’s own notion of a ‘seed” is what we should expect, and the
expectation is confirmed explicitly in B 10,9

Anaxagoras’s theory of nutrition is complementary to that of the seed,
depending as we have seen on the same principle that * hair cannot come
from not-hair’. Vlastos regards the extension of the word ‘seed” to
inorganic matter as a terminological innovation so radical that, while
not agreeing with them, he feels sympathy with those who, like Peck,
refuse to believe in it and try to limit the word in the fragments to the
seed of plants or animals.                 But the explanation of inorganic nature in
texms appropriate to organic is rather, as T hope 1 have shown, a
sign of conservatism, as well as providing, in the current conception of
a seed, the key that he needed to explain how everything comes to be

out of everything else.¥ It is obvious that he took the phenomenon of
nutrition (flesh apparently coming from not-flesh) as the pattern of
every kind of change and assimilation.?
   We may conclude that by a ‘seed’ in fr. 4 Anaxagoras meant an
imperceptibly small bit of any kind of substance, that is, one containing
that particular substance in greater proportion than all the others which
of course are also in it. This is the seed or germ from which that
substance is built up in larger, perceptible quantities. (As Simplicius
puss it: “That appears as gold in which there is much gold, although it
contains all things.’)? There is of course no fixed size for such a seed:
the theory of Anaxagoras precludes anything of the nature of atoms.
Bur since even in the beginning matter had these internal distinctions of
propartion, this probably did not seem to Anaxagoras to be an objec-
tion. Given internal distinctions in the original formation, it was
possible, once the revolution was started by Mind, for the substances
10 come together and build themselves up into perceptible quandties.

    We have seen how the revolution first caused dense, wet, cold and
dark matter to settle in the centre, and the rare, hot and dry to recede
to the farther reaches of the sky. This is in accordance with general
ancient belief abour the action of a vortex. So Aristotle says in De
caelo (295a10) that in earlier cosmogonies earth came together at the
centre ‘ being brought there through the action of the vortex [or whitl].
  * Vlaseas attaches great importance to what he calls che ‘precise and techaical’ use of oxtpuain
Ananagoras fr. 4. The sharp contrust which he sees between this and the *vague and general
fashion” in which it had hitherto been used causes htm to dismiss as irrelevant such expressions as
omtpua mupss (Od. §.490), Tp & tuds atrépuaTos ivbopdv (Pind. Pyeh. 3.37), and the identification
with owépua of the unit from which the world is derived when Aristotle is discussing Pythagorean
theories (Metaph. 1091a16,1092a 32; vol. 1, 276-8). T cannot believe that these expressions were
wholly metaphorical, and they provided a precedent for the idea of omépuaTa of inorganic sub-
stances which would make Anaxagoras's more precise conception a natural and easy one to accept.
   * The community of ideas between the making of a cosmos in Anaxagoras and the growth of
the human body in contemporary physiology becomes plain when one compares Anaxagoras
frr. 15 and 16 with a passage like this from the Hippocrane De genit. 17 (v11, 496 Littré) an the
formation of the embryo: ) bt o&pf cbfoptvn tme Tob Tveluarros &pdpodran, kal Epyeran v alrhi

They all name this as the cause, reasoning from what happens in liquids
and in the air, where larger and heavier bodies always move towards
the middle of a vortex.” So the process continues (fr. 16): ‘From these
things as they are separated off, earth is compacted; for wateris separated
off from the clouds, and earth from water, and from the earth stones are
compacted by the cold, «nd they move outwards more than water.”s
   The first stages of the cosmogony follow the order of Anaximander,
who said that ac the birth of the cosmos something capable of genecating
hotand cold was separated off* from the apeiron, and from this there grew
first a sphere of fire enclosing the eer round the earth. As it proceeds,
Anaxagoras seems to have made use also of the condensation theory of
Anaximenes. The two processes, of the separation of dissimilars and of
condensation, are combined through the common assumption that like
is attracted to like. Thus the Milesian ideas are retained with the modifi-
cations made necessary by Eleatic criticism. These are two: motion can
no longer be assumed as ‘eternal” but must be provided with a cause,
and the original state of matrer cannot be dismissed as simply apeiron.
Since all things are produced out of it, the questions of whether it was
irself one or many, homogeneous or a mixture, and if a mixture what
sortof mixture and in what sense it contained the subsequent products—
these questions have came into the open and must be answered.
     The following doxographic accounts of the cosmogonic process are
vouched for as substantially correct where they overlap the fragments,
and add information about the origin and nature of the heavenly bodies

Hippol. Ref: 1.8.2 (a42): All things partake in motion, being moved by
Mind, and like things come together. Throughout the heavens things have
been set in order by the circular motion. Thus what is dense and moist and
dark and cold, and all heavy bodies, came together in the centre, and their
compaction produced the earth; whereas their opposites, the hot, the bright,
the dry and the light, made for the further region of the aither.... (6) The
sun, the moon, and all the stars are burning stones which have been caught up
by the revolution of the aitker; and below the stars there are certain bodies
carried round with the sun and moon, invisible to us.”         (
Aét. 2.13.3 (a71): Anaxagoras says that the aither around tﬁe universe is
fiery in substance. By the vigour of its rotation it has snatched vp rocks
from the earth, set them on fire and turned them into stars.

    The sun, moon and stars, then, mark an exception to the Igeneral rule
that of bodies caught in a vortex the heavier collect in the centre and
the lighter seek the circumference. This applied to the earlier, slower
stages, but as the revolution increased in speed and violence it caught
up masses of rock from the earth and igpited them, and now keeps
them whirling round at a great distance above the earth.? This theory
evidently owed           much to a striking event which happened during
Anaxagoras’s lifetime and with which his name was connected for
hundreds of years afterwards. About the year 467 B.c. a large meteorite
fell at Aegospotami in the Thracian Chersonese (Gallipoli peninsula).
The ancient testimonies about this are as follows:3
    (a) Pliny, N.H. 2. 149f. (A11): The Greeks tell that in the second year of
the 78th Olympiad (467/6 B.C.) Anaxagoras of Clazomenae predicted by his
knowledge of celestial lore on what days a rock would fall from the sun, and
that this happened in daylight in a district of Thrace near Aegospotami. The
stone is still shown, of the size of a cartload and brown in colour. A comer
also blazed on those nights.
   ! On these bodies see pp. 306{. below.
  * Burnet (£GP, 269) says that this theory *necessarily implies the rotation of the flat earth
along with the “eddy” (8fvn)". Daes it not imply the contrary? If the main mass of the earth was
going round with the eddy instead of resisting it, the eddy would hardly have broken off these
loase fragments and borne them aloft while the rest remarned where it was.
   3 There is also a passing mention in Philostratus’s Life of Apollonius (1.2, A6). For the date
see also Marm. Par. in A1x (468—7), Burnet, EGP, 252, n. 6. It seems to be beyond doubt, bur
it is a little surprising that Plutarch should introduce the incident into the life of Lysander after
 his vivid description of the battle of Aegospotami, on the ground that some people took it for
 a portent of the Athenian debacle, Granted the coincidence of place, an interval of over sixty
years suggests that their credulity was excessive.

                                  Fall of a Meteorite
  (%) D.L. 2.10: They say that he foretold the fall of the stone which took
place at Aegospotami, which he said would fall from the sun.
  () Plutarch, Lysander, 12 (a12): There fell from the sky, according to
general belief, an enormous stone ar Aegospotami. It is stifl shown, for the
Chersonites revere it. Anaxagoras is said to have foretold that through a
slip or shaking (&Mobhuaros A oddov) of the bodies embedded in the sky®
one of them would be torn off and cast down and fall. Each one of the stars,
he claimed, is not in its natural place, for they are stony and heavy, and shine
by the resistance and rupture of the aither. They are dragged forcibly round,
being held tight by the vehement whirl of the revolution, just as at the begin-
ning they were prevented from falling on the earth when cold and heavy
things were being separated off from the whole.. . Daimachus also in his
work On Piety bears out Anaxagoras, recording that for seventy-five days
continuously before the stone fell there was seen in the sky an enormous
fiery body like a faming cloud....When it landed on this spot, and the
natives had recovered from their terror and astonishment and approached,
what they saw was no fire or trace of fire but a stone lying there, of great
size certainly, but nothing ro do, as one might say, with that flaming mass.
   Plutarch usefully fills a gap in our knowledge of Anaxagoras’s
theory. The heavenly bodies are masses of rock which naturally belong
to the central part of the whirl, but, owing to the excessive speed and
violence of the cosmic motion, were carried aloft and heated to incan-
descence by the aither (fire) which, being light, had already taken its
station there.      (Presumably the rather obscure last sentence of fr. 16 is
a reference to this.) This is doubtless why the velocity of the vortex is
given such emphasis in fr. 6: * These things revolve, and are separated
by force and velocity. The velocity creates the force, and their speed
is unlike the speed of anything that now exists in the world of men,
but is assuredly many times as rapid.” Since however they are naturally
heavy, it occasionally happens that a piece of one of them breaks off
and, defeating the centrifugal force of the whirling aizher, falls to the
earth. The theory was either suggested, or appeared to be confirmed,
by the fall of a stone apparently from heaven. Its coincidence with the
appearance of a comet led to the idea that it had heen a part of the fiery

    * D.L. 2. 12 quotes the historian Silenus (third century 5.c.) as saying that when the stone fell
* Anaxagoras explained that the whole sky was composed of stones. Its coherence was due to the
rapidity of its rotation, and if this slackened it would fall.’

body. The belief that Anaxagoras had actually foretold the fall of the
meteorite is fairly obviously a particularization, easy in a credulous age,
 of his general statement that the sun and stars were heavy bodies held
aloft by force, so that it was natural 1o expect that occasionally some-
thing of them would fall.* It is a fair inference from the theory, as well
as from general probability, that the speed of the revolution, which was
started by Mind from zero, showed a gradual acceleration. In its earlier
stages its effect was 10 collect the heavier matter at the centre, but as its
speed and power increased it caught up some fragments of it and
whirled them aloft.            Such acceleration, incidentally, would                   form a
parallel to the accelerating revolution initiated by Strife in the cosmo-
gony of Empedocles. There is a further resemblance in that the effect
of the revolution in both schemes is to bring like things together in
larger masses and to separate unlikes. {Cf. pp. 174, 186 above.) No
sure chronological conclusion can be drawn from these comparisons
however. If Anaxagoras seems the more ‘scientific’, this is rather
because he adhered to the Ionian tradition whereas Empedacles was
closer to the Pythagorean.

                             (7) Cosmology and astronomy
We have noted that most of the extant fragments of Anaxagoras are
from     the first book       and    deal with      causes,    the general       structure     of
matter, and cosmogony. There is enough information to make it clear
that he also dealt at length with questions of cosmology, astronomy and
meteorology, but eur knowledge of his theories on these topics is at
best second-hand.? Many details of his cosmology confirm the state-
ment of Theophrastus that he inherited much of the philosophy of
Anaximenes, but there are fundamental differences of process resulting
from the substitution of a pluralistic for a monistic scheme. Thus both
men thought of the heavenly bodies as originating from the earth; but
Anaximenes, following the monistic hypothesis which sees all things
as transformations of one single substance, explained them as formed
by vaporization of moisture from the earth, which by further rarefaction

  * The only quotation in this field which seems certainly to reproduce Anaxagoras’s own
words is a description of the rainbow (fr. 19), though fr. 18 on the moon’s light is usually, and
perhaps rightly, printed between quotation marks.

                            The Inclination of the Pole
turned to fire. The post-Eleatic pluralist, on the other hand, sees the
process in much more mechanical terms. The stars are stones, torn
from the earth by force and made white-hot by the rapidity of their
motion.t
   Like Empedocles            (p. 101 above), Anaxagoras believed thar the
inclination of the pole was not an original feature of the cosmos, but as
reported he offered no reason for this. Nor is any reason recorded for
the curious idea that it did not occur until after the beginning of life
on the earth.?
D.L. 2.9: The stars ar first moved as round a dome, so that the ever-visible
pole was vertically above the earth, but later took a tilt.
Aét. 2.8.1 (467): Diogenes and Anaxagoras said that after the cosmos
was formed and had produced animals from the earth, it somehow tilted of
its own accord towards the south.
   The doxographer adds the conjecture ‘perhaps by providence, that
some parts might be uninhabitable and others habitable by reason of
cold, torrid heat, or moderate temperature’, thereby confirming the
absence of an explanation in Anaxagoras himself.3
   It is not always easy to visualize the complete world-picture of a
Presocratic thinker. The rotatory process of cosmogony does not
inevitably involve a spherical rather than a hemispherical universe.
Probably Anaxagoras did think of the cushion of air on which the
earth rests as filling the lower half of a sphere, but effectively at least
his universe remains hemispherical. The stars fill a sky that is dome-
shaped, and if, as Hippolytus says (1.8.8, 4 42), their revolution carries

These state definitely that the heavenly bodies are of fire, and contrast them in this respect % 1th
the invisible earthy bodies which accompany them. The passage from the Stromazeis (46, vol. 1,
133) describes his theory 1n terms more nearly appropriate to that of Anaxagoras, unless the
corruption at the end conceals a different meaning.

conjectures that it was because before the inclination the sun shone continuously on the earth,
and Capelle (V. J35. 1919, 191) also speaks of ‘an incomparably stronger action of the sun’s rays
on the horizontally situated disc of the earth’. But ¢f. p. 341, n. 3 below. For the tradition that
animal life was created in the spring cf. Vicg. Georg. 2.338,   On the ¥ywhiots in Anaxagoras see

with Qenopides.

them beneath the earth, the passages just quoted show that this is only
the effect of the inclination of the pole: when that was vertically above
the earth’s centre, they remained above, or level with, its surface, as
Anaximenes bad believed they sill did (vol. 1, 137)." There is no
question of a complete southern hemisphere of stars. The lack of heat
from the stars is explained, as in Anaximenes, by their great distance,
though according to Hippolytus (/oc. cit. 7) Anaxagoras added also
(mysteriously, since they are in the airher) that they are coh;!er than the
sun because they occupy a colder region.                                           i
   Anaxagoras's claim to an outstanding astronomical discovery is
authenticated by Plato, who speaks jokingly of a fantastic erymology
of the word selene as threatening the priority of ‘Anaxagoras’s recent
assertion that the moon has its light from the sun’. This is repeated
(from Theophrastus) in the doxographers, and Plutarch is possibly
quoting the philosopher's actual words when he speaks of ‘ the proposi-
tion of Anaxagoras thar ““ the sun imparts the brightness 1o the moon™’.2
He seems to have given much thought to this and related questions.
Plutarch calls him the man who ‘first and most clearly and boldly put
into writing an account of the illuminations and shadowing of the
moon’, contrasting him in this respect with the superstitious fears
which lunar eclipses aroused in his contemporaries. He was not, says
Plutarch, a figure of the past, and his explanation was still unknown to
all but a few.3 That he explained the moon’s eclipses correctly by the
interposition of the earth’s shadow is implied by Plutarch and stated by
Hippolytus. His scientific achievement in this respect is however
slightly marred when Hippolytus adds ‘and sometimes by the inter-
position of the bodies beneath the moon’, referring to his earlier state-
ment that ‘there are beneath the heavenly bodies certain bodies carried
round with the sun and moon but invisible ta us’. This of coutse is
   * Heath, dristarchus, 83, is perhaps pot a complete answer to the ohjection of Gomperz that
the movement of the stars beneath the earth is inconsistent with the theory that the earch closes
the centre of the cosmos like a Lid, supported on compressed air. No doubt the stars could pass
through air, but if the extent of the earth s sufficient to prevent any of the air from escaping,

simply taken over from Anaximenes, and should have been rendered
superfiuous by the correct explanation of eclipses if, as is generally
thought, that was the original purpose of their introduction,® In this
connexion Boll made an interesting conjecture. Although the moon
was mainly lit by the sun, and was itself mostly of an earthy nature, it
had an admixture of fire (Aét. 2.30.2; at 2§.9 it is even called a “fiery
solid”). This seemed to be proved by the fact that in eclipse it is usnally
still visible through the earth’s shadow as a red glow which later
writers compared to glowing charcoal or embers. Occasionally how-
ever eclipses occur in which the moon disappears from sight altogether
(e.g. in 1601, 1642, 1816; no examples appear to be recorded from ancient
times). Could it be, asks Boll, that since the earth’s shadow was not
sufficient to blot out the moon completely, it seemed 10 Anaxagoras
necessary to suppase that in these cases a solid body had intervened
   The famous statement that the sun was ‘an incandescent stone’,
which was said to have been the occasion of his prosecution for atheism,
is repeated in a number of ancient authors, of whom the eatliest are
Plato and Xenophon.3 It was ‘larger than the Peloponnese’, perhaps
‘many times larger’,#amore cautious estimate than that of Anaximander
that it was the same size as the earth. He said correctly that the sun was
eclipsed at the new moon when the moon sereened it from the earth.

eclipses at Aet. 2.29.6 (A77), which 15 partly obscure {Diels, Dox. 53) and 1n any case attributes
the doctrine to Thales as well as Anaxagoras (1o say nothing of Plata, Artstotle and ol uadnuariol).

   Burnet zlone (EGP, 271) thought it unlikely that a man who believed i a flat earth would
discaver the true cause of eclipses. Heath evidently found tius no difficulty, though he daes cite
the flatness of the earth (and presumed flatness of the moon) as militating against a correct
explanation of the moon’s phases. On eclipses, he found the evidence ‘quite conclusive’.
(Aristarchus, 8of., 78.)
   * Ball, RE, vi,2343f. At Aet. 2.30.2 (A77) w is said that the moon s earthy, but has a mixture
af fice with the dark, “which condition is made visible by the shadowed part’, i.e. presumably by
the part of the moon shadowed in an eclipse. Cf. Plut. De facie, 933: ‘ The moon is not alto~
gether invisible in eclipse, but shows   threatening ember-like tint, which is its natural ¢olour’,
and other passages cited by Boll. (Others have though that the object of the invisible earthy
bodies was to explain meteorites. Boker (RE, 2. Reihe vi 4, 2. 2236) ¢alls them meteors.)

Ic was generally observed in the second half of the fifth cencury that
solar eclipses could only occur at new moon, and Plutarch remarks that
the populace at large already had an idea that they were somehow
caused by the moon, and so were not frightened by them as by lunar
eclipses.” The ‘turnings’ of the sun (solstices) are explained by ‘re-
sistance of the air in the north, which the sun itself compresses and
makes strong by its condensation”’.?
    The moon, like the sun and stars, is an ‘incandescent stor!Ae’. Ttis
below the sun, nearer to us, and its ‘ turnings’ have the same cause as
the sun’s, but are more frequent ‘because it cannot master the cold’.
It is of earthy substance, though with some fire in it, and contains plains,
mountains and valleys. It is also said to be habitable, * with nivers and
everything as on the earth’, but this statement may well be based on
an interpretation of fr. 4 as referring to the moon, which is unlikely.3
The general impression given by the sources is that Anaxagoras
believed the moon to be made of the same stuff as the earth, but hotrer.
1t certainly makes sense (being in fact true) to say thar the moon;s like the
earth with mountains and valleys without implying that it is inhabited.4
  * Nicias, 33.    For contemporury testimuny we have Thuc. 2.28 (referring to the eclipse of
3 August 431 B.C.). For Anaxagoras an the cause of eclipses the authenny is Hippolyrus (Refl
1.8.9, Ag2).
    * Aet. 2.23.2 (a72), explamed by Gilbert thus (Meteor. Th. 686, n. 1), “In its passage from
east 10 wesy, the sun thrusts the ar aside northward and southward This makes the air powerdul,
so that it opposes further progress to north ot south and compels the sun to tpor.’ How exactly
the ancients visualized a world in which thus action and reaction of sun and air could take place 15
a question on which someane with 2 special (ateresc wa such mattees might well throw some fur-
ther bght. Anaxagoras is {ollowing Anaximenes (4 15), and a similar view may have been held by
Anaximander and Diogenes. (See Lee, Arist. Metcor.,Loebed., p.124,n. (2) ) Herodotus believed
that the sun could be driven off 1ts course by storms (2.24), and the Epicureans thought of air-
currents as a possible cause of the mation of the sun through the zodiac, of the moon and of the
stars (Lucr.   §.637—49,   Epicurus, £p.   2, 93)

 The original undifferentiated mass was motionless,                               ‘He starts his
<p>cosmogony from immobility.”<em> The motion introduced by Mind
was the rotation (mreprydpnois) which still continues, as the wheeling
of the heavenly bodies shows.                      We have Anaxagoras's own words
(fr. 12):
Mind controlled the whole rotation so that it started to rotate in the beginning.
It first began to rotate in a small part, but now it rotates over a larger field
and will include a larger one still.. . . And all things that werg to be, all that
were but are not now, all that are now or shall be, Mind arrahged them all,
including this rotation in which now move the stars, sun and ‘moon, air and
fire that are being separated off. Dense is separated from rare, hot from cold,
bright from dark, dry from wet.                   But there are many portipns of many
things, and no one thing is completely separated or divided from another
except Mind.
 The last sentence should need no comment after our examination of
<p>the structure of matter. The notion that the rotating cosmos was at
first small, and is continually growing by drawing in more of the infinite
surrounding it, is interesting, particularly in the light of some recent
cosmogonical theory. The only clear ancient parallel is the way that
the Pythagorean casmos grew from a seed by drawing in the infinite
in its various forms of breath, time and vaid.? Even in this, so far as
our evidence goes, there is no suggestion that the cosmos is still grow-
ing. The notion of the universe as an organic growth was shared by
Anaximander,3 but again there is no suggestion from his remains that
it is gradually growing in size. However, our information about
Anaximander is regrettably scanty, and, in view of the other parallels
between his cosmogony and that of Anaxagoras, it seems possible that
he entertained a similar idea.
 Fr. 13 (p. 274 above) also speaks of Mind initiating the movement,

and says that everything which Mind moved tended to separate, and
that the rotation hastened the pracess of separation; and fr. 9 remarks
on the tremendous speed of the rotation, many times greater than the
speed of anything on earth.
We have seen that a portion of any substance, of whatever size,
<p>contains portions of any other substance, though not in equal propor-
tions. In bone, the proportion of bone exceeds thar of other substances
and so gives it its perceptible character as bone. This proportion would
be maintained however small a speck of bone we imagine, even far
below the level of perception, for <em>the large and the small have portions
equal in number’ (fr. 6 iniz.).
 Now in the original, static mixture it would seem most natural (at
<p>least, for I must be personal here, it would seem so to me) to suppose
that the fusion of everything was thorough and complete, so that no
one thing prevailed over any other in any part of it. Since in origin
the process is not merely mechanical but an ordering controlled by
Mind, the first step could be for portions of each substance to coagulate
and form microscopic specks in which they predominated over the
others, and out of which pieces of bore, flesh, etc., could be amassed
in perceptible quantities as like continued to seek its like in the cosmic
whitl. This however is not what the texts say. Nort only does Anaxa-
goras insist that ‘just as in the beginning, so now all things are together’
(fr. 6), but he also says unequivocally in fr. 4 that in the original ‘all-
things-together’, before separation began, when not even any colour
was discernible, there were not only the opposites and a lot of earth,
but also ‘an infinite number of seeds iz 20 way resembling each other’.
This is exactly the state of things now, when, as he says at the beginning
of the same fragment, all compounds contain seeds of all things with
every kind of shapes, colours and flavours’.
The original state of matter, then, was a mixmre complete to this
<p>extent, that t0 an imaginary observer it would have appeared uniform,
just as would the apeiron of Anaximander before the opposites were
separated out from it. But Anaxagoras is writing under the stern eye
of Parmenides. He knows that because plurality can never be produced
out of strict unity, this apparently uniform matter must in fact be a
mixture of everything that is subsequently to be produced. Its unity

must be only in the eye of the beholder—and, like Empedacles, he
emphasized the inadequacy of the senses, saying that ‘ through their
weakness we cannot judge the truth’;" therefore (one may suppase
hum ta have argued) the distinctions which we now perceive between
substances must have been there from the beginning, only in
measures too fine for our coarser faculties 10 pick up. And this
led him to the original and, it may well be thought, remarkably mature
conception of different kinds of matter as retaining, in however small
a quantity, the same infinite number of ingredients in utchanging
proportions.</p>

The mentions of ‘seeds’ by Anaxagoras in fr. 4 have arrracted much
<p>attention and led to much dispute3 He says there, first, that in the
present world everything contains ‘seeds of all things with every sort
of shapes and colours and flavours’, and secondly, that before the cosmic
separation began, the original mixture contained the opposites, much
earth, and ‘seeds infinite in number’.                   In addition, Aristotle says (De

* 1 have avoided here the later and convenient phrase “infinite divisibiliry’ (cf. Lucretius's
<p>neque corpotibus finem esse secandis, 1.844) because the notion of infinite divisibilicy has troubled
some critics as involving a vicious regress. As it presented itself to Anaxagoras, it would certainly
pot have rroubled him. The infinity of ingredients i the same unequal proportions in any portion
of marter, however small, is the cornerstone of hus cosmogony,        for it ensures that even in the
ocgmal fusion, however large or small a poruon be taken, tiere is the lack of homogeneity which
makes poss:ble the Jater emergence of distinctions in percepuble bulk. The acceptabihity of the
infinite regress (:f one likes to call ir that) is the great discovery which enables him to parry, and
even destroy, \he weapons of Zeno. Raven also (KR, 378) defends Anaxagoras on this point,
but 3t could be rmisfeading 10 say as he does that the nfinste regress *must be at least momentanly
halted” if a sensible world 15 to be bulc up. Anaxagaras describes a state, not a process. Gigan's
observation is helpful (Phifologus, 19367, 17), that to speak of infinite divisibility (a specificalty
mathematical problem) is to look back at Anaxagoras fram Aristotle, whereas he himself was
starting from Parmenides and Zeno,
3 The fullest treatment is that of Vlastos, ‘Phys. Theory of Anaxagoras, L The Seeds’, Philor.
<p>Rev. 1950, 32—41. My quotatans from him muse nat be takea to indicare agreement with
everything 1n this section. His statements that in Emgedocles the elements are exempt from
intermutation and muxzure, and again that in Empedocles as well 2s Parmenides beang and mixture
are incompatible, are at first sight puzzling. It 1s of course solely hecause the elements (the only
6v1a) undergo mixture that according to Empedocles the sensible world can be accounted for.
Viastos's meaning 15 (a5 he has explained to me) that chiere is no radical, ‘chesmical’ fusion of
one element with another biut only juxtaposition of minute parts of each (the view taken in ch.
111, § ¥ of the present work). The somewhat difficult sentence (p. 37,n. 29): “mortahty and mixture
is predicated pot of their fsc. the elements’) heing bur of their temporary conjunciion’ means,
I understand, that although the elements do sy 10 fosm perishable compounds, the terms
‘muxture” and ‘morwl’ cannat dpply 1o an element per si.</p>

of homoeamers like flesh and bone ‘and all the other seeds’, and to
express the same idea elsewhere calls them a panspermia, or aggregation
of seeds, of the homoeomers.
Viastos has rightly emphasized that in thus enlarging the scope of
<p>the word ‘seed’ beyond the organic sphere Anaxagoras must have had
the biological analogy in mind. It may well have been more than an
analogy, for the notion that the whole world and everything in it was
organic fong outlived the transition from mythological                             to rational
thought and is discernible in Anaximander,’ a predecessor for whom
Anaxagoras had especial regard. The contemporary scientific view of a
seed,? as seen in philosophers and medical writers, Vlastos describes as
follows (foc. cit. 34):
A seed is a campound of all the essential constituents of the parent body
from which it comes [the *pangenesis’ theory] and of the new organism
into which it will grow [the ‘pre-formation’ theory]. In its ovular or uterine
environment (or, in the case of vegetable seeds, in the earth) the compound
grows on the principle of ‘like to like’, each ingredient of the seed being
 ‘nourished” by bits of the same stuff supplied by its environment. That this
is Anaxagoras’s own notion of a ‘seed” is what we should expect, and the
expectation is confirmed explicitly in B 10,9</p>
</p>
<p>Anaxagoras’s theory of nutrition is complementary to that of the seed,
depending as we have seen on the same principle that <em> hair cannot come
from not-hair’. Vlastos regards the extension of the word ‘seed” to
inorganic matter as a terminological innovation so radical that, while
not agreeing with them, he feels sympathy with those who, like Peck,
refuse to believe in it and try to limit the word in the fragments to the
seed of plants or animals.                 But the explanation of inorganic nature in
texms appropriate to organic is rather, as T hope 1 have shown, a
sign of conservatism, as well as providing, in the current conception of
a seed, the key that he needed to explain how everything comes to be

out of everything else.¥ It is obvious that he took the phenomenon of
nutrition (flesh apparently coming from not-flesh) as the pattern of
every kind of change and assimilation.?
We may conclude that by a ‘seed’ in fr. 4 Anaxagoras meant an
<p>imperceptibly small bit of any kind of substance, that is, one containing
that particular substance in greater proportion than all the others which
of course are also in it. This is the seed or germ from which that
substance is built up in larger, perceptible quantities. (As Simplicius
puss it: “That appears as gold in which there is much gold, although it
contains all things.’)? There is of course no fixed size for such a seed:
the theory of Anaxagoras precludes anything of the nature of atoms.
Bur since even in the beginning matter had these internal distinctions of
propartion, this probably did not seem to Anaxagoras to be an objec-
tion. Given internal distinctions in the original formation, it was
possible, once the revolution was started by Mind, for the substances
10 come together and build themselves up into perceptible quandties.</p>
</p>
</p>
</p>
 We have seen how the revolution first caused dense, wet, cold and
<p>dark matter to settle in the centre, and the rare, hot and dry to recede
to the farther reaches of the sky. This is in accordance with general
ancient belief abour the action of a vortex. So Aristotle says in De
caelo (295a10) that in earlier cosmogonies earth came together at the
centre ‘ being brought there through the action of the vortex [or whitl].
  <em> Vlaseas attaches great importance to what he calls che ‘precise and techaical’ use of oxtpuain
Ananagoras fr. 4. The sharp contrust which he sees between this and the </em>vague and general

omtpua mupss (Od. §.490), Tp &amp; tuds atrépuaTos ivbopdv (Pind. Pyeh. 3.37), and the identification
with owépua of the unit from which the world is derived when Aristotle is discussing Pythagorean
theories (Metaph. 1091a16,1092a 32; vol. 1, 276-8). T cannot believe that these expressions were
wholly metaphorical, and they provided a precedent for the idea of omépuaTa of inorganic sub-
stances which would make Anaxagoras's more precise conception a natural and easy one to accept.
* The community of ideas between the making of a cosmos in Anaxagoras and the growth of
<p>the human body in contemporary physiology becomes plain when one compares Anaxagoras
frr. 15 and 16 with a passage like this from the Hippocrane De genit. 17 (v11, 496 Littré) an the

They all name this as the cause, reasoning from what happens in liquids
and in the air, where larger and heavier bodies always move towards
the middle of a vortex.” So the process continues (fr. 16): ‘From these
things as they are separated off, earth is compacted; for wateris separated
off from the clouds, and earth from water, and from the earth stones are
compacted by the cold, «nd they move outwards more than water.”s
The first stages of the cosmogony follow the order of Anaximander,
<p>who said that ac the birth of the cosmos something capable of genecating
hotand cold was separated off* from the apeiron, and from this there grew
first a sphere of fire enclosing the eer round the earth. As it proceeds,
Anaxagoras seems to have made use also of the condensation theory of
Anaximenes. The two processes, of the separation of dissimilars and of
condensation, are combined through the common assumption that like
is attracted to like. Thus the Milesian ideas are retained with the modifi-
cations made necessary by Eleatic criticism. These are two: motion can
no longer be assumed as ‘eternal” but must be provided with a cause,
and the original state of matrer cannot be dismissed as simply apeiron.
Since all things are produced out of it, the questions of whether it was
irself one or many, homogeneous or a mixture, and if a mixture what
sortof mixture and in what sense it contained the subsequent products—
these questions have came into the open and must be answered.

Hippol. Ref: 1.8.2 (a42): All things partake in motion, being moved by
Mind, and like things come together. Throughout the heavens things have
been set in order by the circular motion. Thus what is dense and moist and
dark and cold, and all heavy bodies, came together in the centre, and their
compaction produced the earth; whereas their opposites, the hot, the bright,
the dry and the light, made for the further region of the aither.... (6) The
sun, the moon, and all the stars are burning stones which have been caught up
by the revolution of the aitker; and below the stars there are certain bodies
carried round with the sun and moon, invisible to us.”         (
Aét. 2.13.3 (a71): Anaxagoras says that the aither around tﬁe universe is
fiery in substance. By the vigour of its rotation it has snatched vp rocks
from the earth, set them on fire and turned them into stars.</p>
 The sun, moon and stars, then, mark an exception to the Igeneral rule
<p>that of bodies caught in a vortex the heavier collect in the centre and
the lighter seek the circumference. This applied to the earlier, slower
stages, but as the revolution increased in speed and violence it caught
up masses of rock from the earth and igpited them, and now keeps
them whirling round at a great distance above the earth.? This theory
evidently owed           much to a striking event which happened during
Anaxagoras’s lifetime and with which his name was connected for
hundreds of years afterwards. About the year 467 B.c. a large meteorite
fell at Aegospotami in the Thracian Chersonese (Gallipoli peninsula).
The ancient testimonies about this are as follows:3
 (a) Pliny, N.H. 2. 149f. (A11): The Greeks tell that in the second year of
<p>the 78th Olympiad (467/6 B.C.) Anaxagoras of Clazomenae predicted by his
knowledge of celestial lore on what days a rock would fall from the sun, and
that this happened in daylight in a district of Thrace near Aegospotami. The
stone is still shown, of the size of a cartload and brown in colour. A comer
also blazed on those nights.
! On these bodies see pp. 306{. below.
<p>  <em> Burnet (£GP, 269) says that this theory </em>necessarily implies the rotation of the flat earth
along with the “eddy” (8fvn)". Daes it not imply the contrary? If the main mass of the earth was
going round with the eddy instead of resisting it, the eddy would hardly have broken off these
loase fragments and borne them aloft while the rest remarned where it was.
3 There is also a passing mention in Philostratus’s Life of Apollonius (1.2, A6). For the date
<p>see also Marm. Par. in A1x (468—7), Burnet, EGP, 252, n. 6. It seems to be beyond doubt, bur
it is a little surprising that Plutarch should introduce the incident into the life of Lysander after
 his vivid description of the battle of Aegospotami, on the ground that some people took it for
 a portent of the Athenian debacle, Granted the coincidence of place, an interval of over sixty
years suggests that their credulity was excessive.</p>

<p>                                  Fall of a Meteorite
  (%) D.L. 2.10: They say that he foretold the fall of the stone which took
place at Aegospotami, which he said would fall from the sun.
  () Plutarch, Lysander, 12 (a12): There fell from the sky, according to
general belief, an enormous stone ar Aegospotami. It is stifl shown, for the
Chersonites revere it. Anaxagoras is said to have foretold that through a
slip or shaking (&amp;Mobhuaros A oddov) of the bodies embedded in the sky®
one of them would be torn off and cast down and fall. Each one of the stars,
he claimed, is not in its natural place, for they are stony and heavy, and shine
by the resistance and rupture of the aither. They are dragged forcibly round,
being held tight by the vehement whirl of the revolution, just as at the begin-
ning they were prevented from falling on the earth when cold and heavy
things were being separated off from the whole.. . Daimachus also in his
work On Piety bears out Anaxagoras, recording that for seventy-five days
continuously before the stone fell there was seen in the sky an enormous
fiery body like a faming cloud....When it landed on this spot, and the
natives had recovered from their terror and astonishment and approached,
what they saw was no fire or trace of fire but a stone lying there, of great
size certainly, but nothing ro do, as one might say, with that flaming mass.
Plutarch usefully fills a gap in our knowledge of Anaxagoras’s
<p>theory. The heavenly bodies are masses of rock which naturally belong
to the central part of the whirl, but, owing to the excessive speed and
violence of the cosmic motion, were carried aloft and heated to incan-
descence by the aither (fire) which, being light, had already taken its
station there.      (Presumably the rather obscure last sentence of fr. 16 is
a reference to this.) This is doubtless why the velocity of the vortex is
given such emphasis in fr. 6: <em> These things revolve, and are separated
by force and velocity. The velocity creates the force, and their speed
is unlike the speed of anything that now exists in the world of men,
but is assuredly many times as rapid.” Since however they are naturally
heavy, it occasionally happens that a piece of one of them breaks off
and, defeating the centrifugal force of the whirling aizher, falls to the
earth. The theory was either suggested, or appeared to be confirmed,
by the fall of a stone apparently from heaven. Its coincidence with the
appearance of a comet led to the idea that it had heen a part of the fiery

body. The belief that Anaxagoras had actually foretold the fall of the
meteorite is fairly obviously a particularization, easy in a credulous age,
 of his general statement that the sun and stars were heavy bodies held
aloft by force, so that it was natural 1o expect that occasionally some-
thing of them would fall.* It is a fair inference from the theory, as well
as from general probability, that the speed of the revolution, which was
started by Mind from zero, showed a gradual acceleration. In its earlier
stages its effect was 10 collect the heavier matter at the centre, but as its
speed and power increased it caught up some fragments of it and
whirled them aloft.            Such acceleration, incidentally, would                   form a
parallel to the accelerating revolution initiated by Strife in the cosmo-
gony of Empedocles. There is a further resemblance in that the effect
of the revolution in both schemes is to bring like things together in
larger masses and to separate unlikes. {Cf. pp. 174, 186 above.) No
sure chronological conclusion can be drawn from these comparisons
however. If Anaxagoras seems the more ‘scientific’, this is rather
because he adhered to the Ionian tradition whereas Empedacles was
closer to the Pythagorean.</p>
                          (7) Cosmology and astronomy
<p>We have noted that most of the extant fragments of Anaxagoras are
from     the first book       and    deal with      causes,    the general       structure     of
matter, and cosmogony. There is enough information to make it clear
that he also dealt at length with questions of cosmology, astronomy and
meteorology, but eur knowledge of his theories on these topics is at
best second-hand.? Many details of his cosmology confirm the state-
ment of Theophrastus that he inherited much of the philosophy of
Anaximenes, but there are fundamental differences of process resulting
from the substitution of a pluralistic for a monistic scheme. Thus both
men thought of the heavenly bodies as originating from the earth; but
Anaximenes, following the monistic hypothesis which sees all things
as transformations of one single substance, explained them as formed
by vaporization of moisture from the earth, which by further rarefaction

  </em> The only quotation in this field which seems certainly to reproduce Anaxagoras’s own
words is a description of the rainbow (fr. 19), though fr. 18 on the moon’s light is usually, and
perhaps rightly, printed between quotation marks.</p>

<p>                            The Inclination of the Pole
turned to fire. The post-Eleatic pluralist, on the other hand, sees the
process in much more mechanical terms. The stars are stones, torn
from the earth by force and made white-hot by the rapidity of their
motion.t
Like Empedocles            (p. 101 above), Anaxagoras believed thar the
<p>inclination of the pole was not an original feature of the cosmos, but as
reported he offered no reason for this. Nor is any reason recorded for
the curious idea that it did not occur until after the beginning of life
on the earth.?
D.L. 2.9: The stars ar first moved as round a dome, so that the ever-visible
pole was vertically above the earth, but later took a tilt.
Aét. 2.8.1 (467): Diogenes and Anaxagoras said that after the cosmos
was formed and had produced animals from the earth, it somehow tilted of
its own accord towards the south.
The doxographer adds the conjecture ‘perhaps by providence, that
<p>some parts might be uninhabitable and others habitable by reason of
cold, torrid heat, or moderate temperature’, thereby confirming the
absence of an explanation in Anaxagoras himself.3
It is not always easy to visualize the complete world-picture of a
<p>Presocratic thinker. The rotatory process of cosmogony does not
inevitably involve a spherical rather than a hemispherical universe.
Probably Anaxagoras did think of the cushion of air on which the
earth rests as filling the lower half of a sphere, but effectively at least
his universe remains hemispherical. The stars fill a sky that is dome-
shaped, and if, as Hippolytus says (1.8.8, 4 42), their revolution carries

the invisible earthy bodies which accompany them. The passage from the Stromazeis (46, vol. 1,
133) describes his theory 1n terms more nearly appropriate to that of Anaxagoras, unless the
corruption at the end conceals a different meaning.

conjectures that it was because before the inclination the sun shone continuously on the earth,
and Capelle (V. J35. 1919, 191) also speaks of ‘an incomparably stronger action of the sun’s rays
on the horizontally situated disc of the earth’. But ¢f. p. 341, n. 3 below. For the tradition that

the effect of the inclination of the pole: when that was vertically above
the earth’s centre, they remained above, or level with, its surface, as
Anaximenes bad believed they sill did (vol. 1, 137)." There is no
question of a complete southern hemisphere of stars. The lack of heat
from the stars is explained, as in Anaximenes, by their great distance,
though according to Hippolytus (/oc. cit. 7) Anaxagoras added also
(mysteriously, since they are in the airher) that they are coh;!er than the
sun because they occupy a colder region.                                           i
Anaxagoras's claim to an outstanding astronomical discovery is
<p>authenticated by Plato, who speaks jokingly of a fantastic erymology
of the word selene as threatening the priority of ‘Anaxagoras’s recent
assertion that the moon has its light from the sun’. This is repeated
(from Theophrastus) in the doxographers, and Plutarch is possibly
quoting the philosopher's actual words when he speaks of ‘ the proposi-
tion of Anaxagoras thar ““ the sun imparts the brightness 1o the moon™’.2
He seems to have given much thought to this and related questions.
Plutarch calls him the man who ‘first and most clearly and boldly put
into writing an account of the illuminations and shadowing of the
moon’, contrasting him in this respect with the superstitious fears
which lunar eclipses aroused in his contemporaries. He was not, says
Plutarch, a figure of the past, and his explanation was still unknown to
all but a few.3 That he explained the moon’s eclipses correctly by the
interposition of the earth’s shadow is implied by Plutarch and stated by
Hippolytus. His scientific achievement in this respect is however
slightly marred when Hippolytus adds ‘and sometimes by the inter-
position of the bodies beneath the moon’, referring to his earlier state-
ment that ‘there are beneath the heavenly bodies certain bodies carried
round with the sun and moon but invisible ta us’. This of coutse is
* Heath, dristarchus, 83, is perhaps pot a complete answer to the ohjection of Gomperz that
<p>the movement of the stars beneath the earth is inconsistent with the theory that the earch closes
the centre of the cosmos like a Lid, supported on compressed air. No doubt the stars could pass
through air, but if the extent of the earth s sufficient to prevent any of the air from escaping,
where is there room for these great fiery rocks 1o pass beneath sts rim?

simply taken over from Anaximenes, and should have been rendered
superfiuous by the correct explanation of eclipses if, as is generally
thought, that was the original purpose of their introduction,® In this
connexion Boll made an interesting conjecture. Although the moon
was mainly lit by the sun, and was itself mostly of an earthy nature, it
had an admixture of fire (Aét. 2.30.2; at 2§.9 it is even called a “fiery
solid”). This seemed to be proved by the fact that in eclipse it is usnally
still visible through the earth’s shadow as a red glow which later
writers compared to glowing charcoal or embers. Occasionally how-
ever eclipses occur in which the moon disappears from sight altogether
(e.g. in 1601, 1642, 1816; no examples appear to be recorded from ancient
times). Could it be, asks Boll, that since the earth’s shadow was not
sufficient to blot out the moon completely, it seemed 10 Anaxagoras
necessary to suppase that in these cases a solid body had intervened
The famous statement that the sun was ‘an incandescent stone’,
<p>which was said to have been the occasion of his prosecution for atheism,
is repeated in a number of ancient authors, of whom the eatliest are
Plato and Xenophon.3 It was ‘larger than the Peloponnese’, perhaps
‘many times larger’,#amore cautious estimate than that of Anaximander
that it was the same size as the earth. He said correctly that the sun was
eclipsed at the new moon when the moon sereened it from the earth.

Burnet zlone (EGP, 271) thought it unlikely that a man who believed i a flat earth would
<p>discaver the true cause of eclipses. Heath evidently found tius no difficulty, though he daes cite
the flatness of the earth (and presumed flatness of the moon) as militating against a correct
explanation of the moon’s phases. On eclipses, he found the evidence ‘quite conclusive’.

the part of the moon shadowed in an eclipse. Cf. Plut. De facie, 933: ‘ The moon is not alto~

Ic was generally observed in the second half of the fifth cencury that
solar eclipses could only occur at new moon, and Plutarch remarks that
the populace at large already had an idea that they were somehow
caused by the moon, and so were not frightened by them as by lunar
eclipses.” The ‘turnings’ of the sun (solstices) are explained by ‘re-
sistance of the air in the north, which the sun itself compresses and
makes strong by its condensation”’.?
 The moon, like the sun and stars, is an ‘incandescent stor!Ae’. Ttis
<p>below the sun, nearer to us, and its ‘ turnings’ have the same cause as
the sun’s, but are more frequent ‘because it cannot master the cold’.
It is of earthy substance, though with some fire in it, and contains plains,
mountains and valleys. It is also said to be habitable, <em> with nivers and
everything as on the earth’, but this statement may well be based on
an interpretation of fr. 4 as referring to the moon, which is unlikely.3
The general impression given by the sources is that Anaxagoras
believed the moon to be made of the same stuff as the earth, but hotrer.
1t certainly makes sense (being in fact true) to say thar the moon;s like the
earth with mountains and valleys without implying that it is inhabited.4

ther bght. Anaxagoras is {ollowing Anaximenes (4 15), and a similar view may have been held by
Anaximander and Diogenes. (See Lee, Arist. Metcor.,Loebed., p.124,n. (2) ) Herodotus believed
that the sun could be driven off 1ts course by storms (2.24), and the Epicureans thought of air-
currents as a possible cause of the mation of the sun through the zodiac, of the moon and of the
stars (Lucr.   §.637—49,   Epicurus, £p.   2, 93)

<p>                          The Moon. The Milky Way
According to Aristotle, Anaxagoras shared with Democritus a
<p>curious theory abour the nature of the Milky Way. They maintain, he
says (Mereor. 345225, trans. Lee), ‘that the Milky Way is the light of
certain stars. The sun, they say, in its course beneath the earth, does
not shine upon some of the stars; the light of those upon which the
sun does shine is not visible to us, being ohscured by its rays, while the
Milky Way is the light peculiar to those stars which are screened from
the sun’s light by the earth.’
Aristotle notes the obvious objection to this that the Milky Way
<p>should change with the sun’s position. He also attacks it from the
standpoint of greater astronomical knowledge, for it demands that
the sun be smaller than the earth, whereas he knew it to be greater.
It might also be asked how on this theory we can see the stars outside
the Milky Way at night any more than in the daytime. Presumably,
as Alexander in his commentary                   implies, what we see is (as with
the moon) a reflexion of the sun’s light, whereas the stars of the
Milky Way are shining with their own."                    At the least it was a brilliant
guess that the luminous band in fact consists of myriads of separate
stars,</p>
</p>
</p>
His opinion about comets (of which he had seen a notable example,
<p>p- 303 above and Seneca, Nat. Qu. 7.5.3, 483) was that they were a
collection or conjunction® of planets, so near one another as to appear
to be in contact. Shooting stars are thrown off in the sky like sparks,
and quickly quenched (Hippol. 1.8.10, D.L. 2.9, A&amp;t 3.2.9, 482).
Nothing      in the sources suggests that he connected                       them with the
spectacular meteorite that fell in his time.
Pythagoras himself was one of the daimones whabiting the moon (fr. 192 Rose, p. 136 Ross); the
Islands of the Blest were the sun and moon 1n the Pythagorean catechism (lambl. ¥.P, 82);
Proclus antributes 1o Pythagoras and the theologos (i.e. Orpheus) a line which says that the moon
has mouniains, cities and halls (Kern, Ozpk.f5, 91). Ci. also Plato, Zim. 42d. It1s unhkely that
Auaxagaras had much sympathy for Pythagorean beliefs. True, 1o less z scientisc than Aristotle
speaks of a kind of living creatures whose nacure is fiery and who must be sought on the moon
(G4, 761b1y—23); but these would scarcely be human beings, and his dismissal of the idea as
&amp;Xhos Adyos suggests that it is perhaps a concession to religious thought which did not greatly
interest him.

                               (8) Earth and sea
<p>Ignoring or rejecting the different theories of Anaximander, Xeno-
phanes and (if he knew of it) his contemporary Empedocles, Anaxa-
goras went back ta Anaximenes for the view that the earth, which he
stii! believed 1o have a flat surface like 2 tympanum, was supported on
a cushion of air. This is stated by Aristotle, and the version of Hippo-
lytus is that ‘the earth is flat in shape, and remains aloft on account of
its size, and because there is no void and the air, being veryipowerful,
carries the earth riding upon it’. The theory is attributéd also to
Democritus, and its familiarity in the fifth century is attested both by
the satire of Aristophanes, who in the Clouds makes Socrates pray to
‘the lord and master, measureless Air, who holdest the earth aloft’,
and by a similar prayer in the Troades of Euripides to ‘the chariot
of the earth’. This last phrase is also used of the air in the Hippocratic
treatise De flatibus. The notion that the air is a divinity which
may be the object of prayer is of course foreign to Anaxagoras and
Democritus, and must be taken from their contemporary Diogenes
of Apollonia.!
The surface of the earth is porous, and it is riddled underneath with
<p>cavities. According to Aristotle, Anaxagoras said that earthquakes
occur when aitker, coming up from below, gets trapped in these
hollows because the pores of the upper surface have become clogged
with rain. The earth has both an upper surface (on which we live) and
a lower (which presumably has not had its pores clogged, so that the
air beneath can penetrate).           Aétius puts it that air gets in under the
earth, is compressed and strikes the surface, then makes its surround-
ings shake because it cannot disperse. 1t is remarkable that Aristotle
should use the word aitker, which was the term used by Anaxagoras for
fire. Even in his own vocabulary it does not mean air, of the dense
sort that is underneach the earth, so it is probable that he is using
the terminology of the earlier thinker. If this is so, both he and the
doxographers       are giving a partial account, and the full explanation</p>

theory, though the positive evidence is slight (a scholium on Basil, DK, 64 4 163).

is that given by Seneca, who describes the theory as involving both
air and fire in conflict. Anaxagoras will then, as Gilbert suggested
and as is very plausible, have connected earthquakes and volcanic
eruptions.’
The cavities beneath the earth contain water, and rivers are formed
<p>both from these and from rain. The sea is partly fed by rivers, but in
origin consists of water which lay on the earth or was drawn up from
within it by the heat of the sun. Part of this was vaporized and the rest
became salt and bitter. Aétius seems 1o imply that this was due to
‘burning”       by the sun, but Alexander armributes to Anaxagoras                            and
Metrodorus the view that water becomes salt by being filtered through
the earth, which contains various salts and sharp-tasting substances.
Possibly Anaxagoras combined both explanations.?
The cause of the Nile’s summer floods aroused much curiosity among
<p>the Greeks, and Anaxagoras championed the view that they were due
to the melting of snow among mountains further South, in Ethiopia.
This is repeated not only by his reputed pupil Euripides but also by the
other two tragedians Aeschylus and Sophocles.                        Since it is not far off
the truth, it is a pity that Herodotus found                        it ‘though        the most
plausible, the most erroneous view’.3

An Arabsc translapon of Galen (quoted by DX, 4 90) gives Anaxagoras as authonty for the fact
that water, when subtected to a lugh degree of heat, becomes salty or bitter. The process is
explained in greater detail in the Hippocratic De aere ag. foc. 8: the heat draws up the finest and

  condensed or moistened.’
   Thunder, lightning, thunderbolts, whitlwinds and the preszer (for
<p> which see vol. 1, 463, n. 3) are all different effects of the dowaward cush
 of fire from the upper part of the sky to the colder regions of aer,
 causing a clash of hot and cold. Lightning is this fire as it pierces the
 clouds, thunder the noise of its being quenched in them, and so on.?
 Clouds and snow, says Aétius (3.4.2, 485), he explained like Anaxi-
 menes. Hail is produced when a cloud is forced upwards and reaches a
 region where the temperature is lower because the reflexion of the sun’s
rays from the earth does nor reach it. Then the water in it is frozen.
Hailstorms are therefore more frequent in summerandin warm districts,
because the heat forces the clouds further up from the earth.3 On the
rainbow we have Anaxagoras’s own words (fr. 19): ‘The reflexion of
the sun in the clouds we call a rainbow. It is a sign of storm, for the
water flowing round (?) che cloud creates wind or pours down rain.’
Empedocles also said that the rainbow brings wind or rain.5 There is
no evidence that Anaxagoras enumerated any of the colours of the
rainbow as Xenophanes had done (fr. 32), or tried to explain them like
Anaximenes (vol. 1, 139).5

<p>                    Meteorology: One World or More?
                           (10) One world or more?
<p>As with Anaximander, there has been controversy over the question
whether Anaxagoras believed our world (kosmos) to be unique. It
looks at least as if Theophrastus reported that he did. There is, it is
true, little value in the lists drawn up by Aétius of those who believed
in one cosmos and those who believed in an infinite number; but his
inclusion of Anaxagoras in the former category is supported by
Simplicius, who writes:
Those who say that the cosmos is unique, like Anaxagoras and Empedocles,
have no need of an infinity of elements, so that Empedocles does better to
make them limited.®</p>
</p>
<p>  1t 15 also parural to conclude from a passage in Aristotle’s Physics
(250b 18-27) that he is classing Anaxagoras and Empedocles together
as believers in one world only.
It might well be thought thar the uniqueness of the cosmos is stated
<p>in surviving words of Anaxagoras hirself, when he says (fr. 8): “The
things in the one cosmos are not separated from one another nor cut
off with an axe.” 1t has been argued that these words refer only to the
internal structure of the universe: it is one, a unity, because nothing in
it is separated from anything else.<em> But this, whether true or not, is not
in itself evidence of a plurality of worlds. The most that can be said
is that, if there is external evidence of plurality, this fragment does not
necessarily contradict it. In fact however the external testimony is all
the other way.
The question is bound up with an interesting and puzzling passage
<p>in fr. 4. After a sentence (quoted on p. 288 above) about the mixture
 ' Agt. 2.1.2 (Dov. 327), partially quoted in DK, A 63; Sitnpl. Phys. 178.25. Gigon, who argues
<p>for a pluralicy of xoauat in Anaxagoras (in which ke thinks he was following Anaximander, but
ef. vol. 1, 10661}, makes no reference to this passage in Simplicius. He cutes instead (PAifo/.
1936-7, 25} Phys. 27.17, where, speaking of Mind, Simplicius says that Anaxagoras made it the
canse of movement and coming-to-be, ‘by which things were separated, and brought into being
Tobs 1t xbopous ka) Thy T EAwy puow”. Simpheius has evidently been careless in one of the
YWD passages, and the statement at 178. 25 is much more definite and convincing than the vague
and imprecise expressions used here. If 1olg xéauovs means “worlds’, what is Ty i @haw
glaw? Of other disputants, Gigon notes that he is siding with Gomperz and Burnet aganst
Zeller—Nestle and Capelle.

<p>                                        Anaxagoras
of many things in all, and the immense variety of ‘seeds’, Anaxagoras
continues with curious abruptness:
And [we must suppose that] men have been formed and all the other animals
that have life; and the men have settled cities and cultivated fields as with
us, and sun and moon and the rest as with us; and the earth grows all sorts
of produce for them, the most useful of which they gather into their houses
and use. This is my account of the separating off, that it must have taken
place not only where we live, but elsewhere also.
The sudden indication, by the words ‘as with us’, that Anaxé,goras is
not describing the part of the world familiar to the Greeks, takes one by
surprise.” His description of the moon as resembling the earth led some
to suppose that it is referred to here, but it seems highly improbable
that its inhabitants should have ‘sun and moon as with us’. Others have
therefore assumed that he is speaking of wholly different kosmof, though
there is no other hint of these in the fragments, and the external evi-
dence, as we have seen, is strongly against it.
There is a third possibility, the only one which occurs to Simplicius
<p>apart from his own Neoplatonic theory of a contrast between the
sensible and intelligible worlds. This is that Anaxagoras is referring to
other parts of the earth’s surface. In Plato’s Phacedo (109b) Socrates
mentions a belief that there are many hollows in the surface of the earth,
with water in them forming seas and air above, and the inhabited world
as known to the Greeks—‘between the Phasis and the Straits of
Gibraltar’—is only one of these, in which we live ‘like ants or frogs
round a marsh; many other men dwell elsewhere in many similar
places’. Burnet, though in his Zarly Greek Philosophy he argued that
Anaxagoras believed in innumerable worlds, says in his commentary
on the Phaedo: ‘As Wyttenbach saw, this part of the theory comes from
Anaxagoras (and Archelaus)’, and as Cornford saw, it almost certainly
provides the key to fr. 4. It does nothing to contradict the statements
  ¥ It is always possible that Simplicius, to whom alone we owe the fragment, has omitred some-
thing. Franke) (Wege . Formen, 287,n. 1) thinks 1t probable that fr. 415 made up of three distinet
quotations which do not belong together. Bailey (G, Aromists and Epic. 542) supposed Tofs
ouyxpwoutvars in the first part of the fragment 1o refer to a plurality of <em> compound worlds® |

</em> See further Cornford in CQ, 1934, 7f. Kahn (Anaximander, §2£) agrees. I cannat make
much of the unsupported statement of Gigon (Philol. 19367, 26) that Anaxagoras cannot have
meant another part of the earth, ‘denn die Erde scheidet sich als Eines und Ganzes ab, und nicht
hier e Teil und dort ein anderer’.
Yet another imerpretation should be mentioned, though I do not find it convincing. H. Frankel

<p>                                Origin of Living Things
of all our authorities that Anaxagoras believed in one cosmos oaly,
which is in any case what his account of cosmogony would naturally
lead one to expect, as we follow its progress from the initiation of the
revolution by Mind to the formation of natural kinds.
                     (1x) Origin and nature of living things
<p>In general Anaxagoras adopted the widespread view that life first arose
from moisture, heat and earch.” He thus continued the lonian rational-
ization of a belief that went back beyond the beginnings of scientific
thought, adapting it ingeniously to his own system. fer (air, mist,
cloud), as we have seen, was for Anaxagoras not a simple body but an
amalgam of all the substances which wenr to make up plants, animals
and inanimate objects.              Consistently with this, Theophrastus writes:
‘Anaxagoras says that the air contains the seeds of all things and these
are brought down together with the water and generate plants.” The
second-century          Chnstian bishop Irenaeus says that this applied to
animals t00:<em> they were created decidentibus e caelo in terram seminibus.3
His authority by itself would not be strong, but this too fits in with the
general theory and may be allowed to supplement the bare starement
that life arose from the wet, the hot and the earthy.
The way in which this scheme combines originality with an un-
<p>conscious reflexion of older mythical descriptions of the same belief
presents a fascinating paradox.                In mythology Sky was the father who
impregnated Earth the mother with the rain which was his seed, and it
grew in the warmth of her bosom. Alternatively, to make the first
worman the fire-god mixed earth and water.# For Anaxagoras the atheist,

by heat.
Aristotle, not surprisingly, found it difficult to decide whether
<p>Anaxagoras 1dentified Mind (nous) and life (psyche) or distinguished
between them.” When he says (fr. 11) ‘In everything there is a portion
of everything except Mind, and in some things there is Mind to0’, he
seems to be distinguishing the whole animate world from the in-
animate. Atits lowest level, psyche was that in living things which gave
them the power of self-motion; at higher levels it was the faculty of
cogpition. By setting Mind at the source of all motion, Anaxagoras
blended the two (as indeed they had been assimilated, though less
explicudy, in much earlier thought); but for inanimate things it is an
external force, for animate beings an internal faculty. Even plants have
a degree of sensation and thought, as Empedocles also believed.                                  If we
can trust the ps.-Aristotelian De plantis, they feel pleasure and pain,
and also breathe. They are in fact ‘earthbound animals’, a notion which
was retained by Plaro.<em>
‘Mind is all alike’, so the apparent difference of mental levels between
<p>different living things would appear to be due to difference in their
bodily structure. This is confirmed by Auristotle in 2 passage which
strikingly points the contrast berween the mechanism of Anaxagoras
and his own teleological outlook:
Anaxagoras says that man is the wisest of animals because he has hands, but
it is reasonable ro suppose that he received hands because he is the wisest.
The hand is a tool, and nature like a wise man allots each ool to the one wha
is able ta use it.3

<p>                              Nature of Living Things
On     the question why            men     themselves         are not all equally clever,
Anaxagoras is said to have remarked that though all men have intellect
they do not always use it. (See Psellus in atora.)
There is evidence that he too was keenly interested in biological and
<p>physiological questions. His general theory that all living things
breathed, says Aristotle (De resp. 470b 30), made him turn his attention
to fish, and he said correctly that they breathe through their gills.
Sleep was a bodily, not a psychic affection, due to bodily exhaustion.
There is little evidence of what he said about death, but his general
theory left no room for individual survival.’ Galen raises the question
whether blood originates in the body or ‘isinterspersed with the food’,
and attributes the latter view to ‘ thase who helieve in homaeomers’
(De nat. fac. 2.8, A104). Itis of course an integral part of Anaxagoras’s
general theory. Of disease, he said that acute diseases are caused by the
gall-bladder overflowing and sending gall to the lungs, blood-vessels
and flanks (Arist. Part. an. 67725). On reproduction, he held that
distinction of sex exists already in the seed, which comes entirely from
the male parent, and that males are engendered by seed from the right-
hand testicle? congealing in the right side of the womb. There is no
mention of the effect of temperature as there is in Empedocles, who
claimed that both parents provide semen and sex is determined by
conditions in the womb.3 Aristotle (G4, 756 b13) chides Anaxagoras
and others for their simplicity in believing that ravens and ibises
copulate by the mouth, and among quadrupeds the weasel (galé) gives
birth through the mouth.
* The only informauon is the senlence in the Placita (5 25.2, A103): dvar B kal yuyfis

to the soul also’. This may be a very crude, even inaccurare, rendeting of anything thar Anaxa-
goras himself said. The immediately following references to Leucippus and Emgedocles on the
same subject are not reassuring. But the survival as such of an individual soul, or portion of
Nous, after the dissolution of the temporary bodily concrenon w hich housed it, would contradier
all the rest of his theory of realiy, and he was no Empedacles 1o pur beside it a doctrine of an
indwelling daimon. Cf ZN, 1242, n. 1; Rohde, Peyche, 188,

                                    (12) Sensation
<p>Anaxagoras’s notions on the mechanism of sensation, as summarized
by Theophrastus,? scem rather crude. In general, he was opposed to
Empedocles in saying that sensation was due to action between unlikes:
if our sense of touch tells us that something is warm or co‘(ld7 this is
because the hand which touched it is colder or warmer.                            In general we
see better by day, because most people’s eyes are dark, and the objects
are illuminated. Like many others, he thought it sufficient explanation
of sight to say that it was due to the reflexion of the object in the eye,
He claimed that the powers of sensation depended on the size of the
sense-organ: animals with large, clear, lustrous eyes see large and
distant objects, and so on. There is no attempt 1o relate the working of
the separate senses to the statement that they all originate in the brain,
except in the case of hearing, where it is said that it depends on the
penetration of the sound to the brain; ‘for rhe surrounding bone is
hollow, into which the sound falls’ {i.e. presumably the bone enclosing
the brain).3
He pronounced that all sensation was accompanied by pain. This he
<p>deduced from the assumption that it was the affection of a sense-organ
by something dissimilar to it,* but the notion not unnaturally met with
considerable criticism in antiquity. As empirical evidence he adduced
the discomfort caused by excessive or prolonged stimulation of the
senses.     Presumably the argument was that if sensation in a certain</p>

</p>
</p>
                          (13)     Theory of knowledge
<p>He emphasized the inadequacy of the senses, as this passage from
Sextus shows (Math. 7.90, Anaxagoras fr. 21):
Anaxagoras with his exceptionally scientific outlook says in disparagement
of the senses, ‘owing to their weakness we are unable to discern the wuth’,
and as proof of their untrustworthiness he adduces the gradual change of
colour. If we take two colours, black and white, and pour one into the other
drop by drop, our sight will not be able to pick out the gradual alterations
although they exist in reality.
Cicero therefore was no doubr right in including Anaxagoras among
others of the ancients who denied the possibility of attaining certain
knowledge by human faculties alone, like Parmenides, Empedocles,
Alemaeon      and     Xenophanes,®          Some      of these, contrasting human
uncertainty    with    divine       omniscience,     could    claim    to have    received
the truth from heaven, but this was not in keeping with the rational-
istic Ionian tradition of which Anaxagoras was an outstanding repre-
sentative. Although however he could not use this language (so far
as we know, he never referred to Mind as God), he did believe that
Mind knew everything, and that our participation in it enabled us to
go behind the senses and infer the reality which underlay them. Only
Mind can penetrate beyond the coarse organs of sense to become
aware of the ultimate constitution of things. They perceive only ‘that
which predominates’, but Mind knows that ‘there is a portion of every-
thing in everything’. This is implied by his pronouncement (fr. 212)
that ‘ phenomena are a sight of the unseen’. Aristotle, after quoting the
lines of Parmenides which claim that our perception and understanding
depend on the condition of the body, adds: ‘ There is also related a
saying of Anaxagoras 1o some of his associates, that things would be
for them such as they supposed them to be.’<em> ‘Sayings” were attached

very lightly to any of the great philosophers, and this one sounds more
like an echo of onc of the contemporary Sophists; but there was con-
siderable mutual influence between the Sophists and the natural philo-
sophers, and on the level of the average sensual man this is something
like what Anaxagoras must have believed.t</p>
</p>
                                   (14) Conclusion
<p>In his rationalistic and secular outlook Anaxagoras was)a typical
Ionian, who knew his Ionian predecessors, especially Anaximander and
Anaximenes, and made use of their ideas. But he was an Ionian after
Parmenides and Zeno, and his theories had to be adapted to their
paradoxical but inescapable conclusions. His achievement is usually
summed up as twofold: the idea of Mind as the moving, ordering and
ruling force in the universe, and the theory of the structure of matter.
The former has acquired special prominence in the light of later
philosophy, especially its role in the teleological systems of Plato and
Aristotle.      Both of these acknowledged its novelty, but complained
that Anaxagoras failed to make proper use of it. The role of Mind, in
fact, had a recognizable ancestry in the divine substance which in the
earlier Ionian systems ‘rules over’ (xporrel) or ‘steers” (kuPepvd) the
whole. The great difference was that, owing to the challenge of Par-
menides on the subject of motion, the first cause of it has at last been
separated from marerial substance in a clear-cut dualism.                          One        must
* F. Lammly, 1 the secuion of his book Vonr Chaos qum Kosmes which he enutles ‘Anaxagoras
<p>the “Sophist”” (1, 92-6), argues that Anaxagoras may very well have incorparated 1 or added to
his cosmogony 2 more or less ‘sophistic’ doctnne of the ongin of civihzation. He therefore
denies Jaeger's statement (TEGP, 164) that ‘Anaxagoras’s philosoply is physics through and
through; it obviously contains no anthropology      in the thealogical sense [oddly enough,    these
italicized words from the original are missing in Limmli’s quotation from the German edition]
and completely lacks any centre of gravity of that sort’, In his own support Lammb refers 1o
Frankel, Wege u. Formen, 285, who wnites: <em> The 1nclusion of culture and society in the sphere of
things which are produced by a kind of &amp;méxpiais and ouvBeos marks the system of Anaxagoras
as anthropocentric, not physiocentric.” The evidence is mainly fr. 4, bac there are of course one
or 1wo other passages which may show an interest in the origins of human culture, such as A 10z
on the importance of the hands and fr. 21 b on man's use of the lower animals. There 15 also the

the pasitive evidence for an interest (n human affasss 1 Anaxagoras, comparable 10 that of the
Sophists, is meagre. The statement of Favorinus (ap. D.L, 2.11) that he ‘showed the subject of
the Homeric poems to be virtue and justice’ probebly applies more partcularly to his followers
like Metrodorus, who ‘defended the thesis further’.    (I have translated the German   of Lammlt
and Frinkel,)

<p>                            Originalivy and Subtlety
distinguish here, as often in the history of thought, between an idea in
the mind of the man who first thought of it and its development by
those who followed him. With the conception of Mind as the ultimate
cause of order and regularity in the material world, and itself some-
thing separate from matter, independent and self-gaverning, the seed
of a fully teleological view of nature has been planted, as Plato and
Aristotle frankly admitted. Plato’s Socrates ‘rejoiced and thought that
he had found a master after his own heart’; for Axistotle he was “the
first sober man’. The praise is as ready as the subsequent criticism is
outspoken. The seed is sown, but it grew and flowered under the hands
of others.
His originality and subtlety show themselves more plainly in his
<p>theory of matter, which lacked the simplicity of Democritean atomism,
bur must be given all credit for its ingenuity. The atomists were in-
debted to him for the notion of infra-sensible reality: ‘phenomena are
a sight of the unseen’ (fr. 21), a saying which Democritus is said to
have quoted with approval. It led him also fo two other creditable
achievements: the idea of the infinitesimal and an advance on the crude
Milesian conception of ‘opposites’. The hot and the cold are not
‘separated or cut off from each other with an axe’—a step towards
seeing them as points on a continuous scale.</p>
</p>
</em> His doctrine of matter
carries us a stage further on the road to atomism, from which however
it differed in two fundamental ways: in the principle of infinite divisi-
bility, with which ‘atomism’ is a contradiction in serms, and in sup-
posing that every particle of matter, however small, was endowed with
all sensible qualities—including the ‘secondary” qualities like colour,
taste and smell which for Democritus were purely subjective—although,
it might be, to a degree too small to be perceptible.
 In one field his mechanistic type of explanation, and refusal to have
<p>any truck with contemporary animistic or other religious beliefs, was
not altogether an advantage. The Pythagorean hypathesis that the
celestial bodies moved according to mathematical laws was much more
fruitful for astronomy than Anaxagoras’s idea that they were dragged
around by the whirling aizfer. But the rationally organized movements
of the heavenly bodies were for the Pythagoreans bound up with their

<li><p>Chronology of Anaxagoras's life
D.L. 2.7 reports three accounts. (1) He ‘is said’ to have been 20 at
the time of Xerxes’s invasion of Greece and to have lived j172 years.
(2) According 1o Apolledorus, he was born in OL 70 (500—497) and
died in the firet year of OL 78 (468, emended by Scaliger to O 88, i.c.
428). Eusebius, DK, 44, similarly thought that his dates were . [
<ol>
<li>(3) According to Demetrius of Phalerum he began to ‘philo-
sophize’ at Athens in the archonship of Callias at the age of 20, ‘where
also they say that he lived 30 years’. A Callias was archon in 456, but
the archon of 480 was Calliades, for which Callias is only an alternative
form (ZN, 1197; Taylor, CQ, 1917, 82, n. 1). If we accept with
Scaliger that the mention of Ol. 78 is an error,* the three sources of
Diogenes agree well, and there are many indications that Anaxagoras
did not die in his prime and that he was active much later than 468.                        If
he first came to Athens aged 20 ‘at the time of Xerxes’s invasion’, the
chances are that he was a conscript in Xerxes’s army, for as a Clazo-
menian he would be a Persian subject (Burnet, £GP, 254). Demetrius’s
report may have meant no more than that he became interested in
philosophy as a student at tha: time.
The difficulties increase when we try to fit in the prosecution which
led to bis exile and so determine which were the 30 years that he spent
at Athens. Diogenes already knew of contradictory versions. The
strongest evidence is that the trial took place just before the beginning
of the Peloponnesian War, not much earlier than 430. This is said by
Diodorus (12.38£), Plutarch (Pericles, 32) and Sotion (ap. D.L.2.12).

<li>The alternative is to suppose with Davison (CQ, 1953, 40) that by yeyevfiodat Apollodorus
meant ‘flourished’, as he plainly did when speaking of Anaximenes (D.L. 2.3), and had placed
Anaxagoras about 40 years too early owing to his own mistaken idea (from Epicurean sources)
that Democntus was born ¢. o0 and the statement attribured to Democritus himself that he was
40 years younger than Anaxagoras (p. 386 below).

a much earlier date. Plutarch says the prosecution was brought under
the decree of Diopeithes for the impeachment of atheists and ‘meteoro-
logists’, which must be dated c. 433. Diodorus mentions the trial as
one of the causes of Pericles’s unpopularity which led him to plunge
the city into war.   According to Sotion, the penalty was a fine of five
talents plus exile. The other tradition known to Diogenes is represented
by Satyrus, who said that the instigatar of the trial was Thucydides,
the charge was medism as well as impiety and Anaxagoras was
sentenced to death iz absentia. This would almost certainly have been
before the ostracism of Thucydides son of Melesias in 443.
In spite of the championship of A. E. Taylor, the view that Anaxa-
goras was condemned and left Athens finally about 450 is scarcely
tenable. J. S. Motrison (CQ, 1941, §, n. 2) even thinks that it ‘runs
contrary to the whole weight of the evidence’, and his continued
presence at Athens at a later date is certainly hard to doubt. A difficulty
is caused by the implicadon of Plato (Phasdo, 97b, 98b) that Socrates
knew Anaxagoras only through his book and never met him. On this
Zeller had something to say (ZN, 1199), but perhaps the most plausible
conclusion is that Anaxagoras’s thirty years in Athens (doubtless a
round figure anyhow) were not continuous. This has been argued by
Davison, who suggests that he was twice forced to leave Athens, once
by the prosecution of Thucydides perhaps abour 455, and then again,
after returning under an amnesty some eleven years later, about 432.
‘The alternative is to believe, as some do, that he first arrived in Athens
‘in the archonship of Callias’, i.e. 456, but apart from the statement
that his arrival coincided with Xerxes'sinvasion, an intermitrent sojourn
in Athens between the 470’s and the 430’s certainly makes it easier to
fit in the various reports about him, for example, that Themistocles
knew him (Stesimbrotus ap. Plut. Zhem. 2) and Pericles was his pupil.

to Pythagoras (ZN, 1203, 1. 2).
(d) Fr. 910. This is the famous fragment on the happiness of a life
devoted to the study of the ageless order of nature. Though same

thinker of a more primitive type’ (EGP, 255).

things unseen’, is very close to the dictum of Anaxagoras that ‘ pheno-
mena are a sight of the unseen (&amp;8nAc)” (fr. 21a), and may well have
been modelled on it. The language on the other hand (Texuonpduestor

1958, 78 . The word duciousptis does not occur in the extant fragments
of Anaxagoras, and since later authorities use it to describe the key-
conception of his doctrine one would expect it to be quoted at least
once. Tt does not occur at all before. Aristotle, and the idea expressed
by it is carefully explained by Plato in the Protagoras (329d-e; see
Shorey, CP, 1922, 350) without the use of the term itself. Mathewson
notes that of forty-five compounds 1 -pepss cited by Buck and Petersen
none is pre-Aristotelian; also that the one thing in Anaxagoras that
could be called duoiopsprs      in the sense in which   Aristotle   uses the
word is voUs and he does not use it of vols.
  Whereas Aristotle uses the adjective duotoueptis with reference to
Anaxagoras, the doxographers have more commonly the noun ducio-
wépeix, @ word which is absent from Aristotle and first occurs in
Epicurus. (See the word-index to Arrhighetti’s ed., p. 646.) Three
writers indicate their belief that this term was used by Anaxagoras
himself.

is parenthetical, and it seems fair, if we wish, to characterize it with
Mathewsan (loc. cir. 78) as ‘a single lapse’ and ‘not very diswirbing’.
It is contradicted by another sentence of the same writer, where he
follows Aristotle exactly (Cael. 6o3.18): kai "A. &amp; Spoiopepd, olov

equated dnowopepTy with oméppara in the passage on which Simplicius

of considerable     interest.    The   word    épotopépaicn   here     is not   used
synonymously with the &amp;poiopepfi of Aristotle. It does not mean
things whose own parts are like each other and like the whole thing,
but things which are, or whose parts are, like the things of which they
themselves are (or become) parts. Food, for instance, is; called a
Suotopépeix not as being homogeneous but because when! eaten it
turns into the bones and tissues of our body and therefore must have
contained those ‘parts” all the time. This is an accurate description of
the material &amp;pyoi of Anaxagoras.                                        :
(3) Lucr. 1.834 rerum quam dicit homoeomeriam.               Here the word is
given yet another sense, being used collectively of the whole mass of
matter according to Anaxagoras’s theory of its composition. Bailey
(Gk. dromists, 555) calls this use of the singular ‘startling” and * quite
unique’, but in fact it is used in the same way by Simplicius, Phys.
162.31: BveoTw &amp;poa &amp;v T Ouowopspeiq xod odp kol doTolv wad
alpa kTA. Lucretius’s ‘quam dicit” may well have been a natural,
though erroneous, inference from a passage such as this. Bailey, noting
that these uses of the noun could not have been developed from
Aristotle’s adjective, thought that these authors must be believed when-
they say that Anaxagoras used it himself. His ‘surmise’ (his own word)
is that ‘Anaxagoras himself probably used the substantive for the
theory, duoiouepf] omépuara for the “seeds”, and duotopepf for the
substances composed of such seeds. The concrete use of Spotopépeiar
for the seeds by the doxographers and commentators was then a later
development.” (Lucr. vol. 11, 745.) Perhaps this possibility cannot be
ruled out, but the likelihood that the words are inventions of later
date, and the doxographers mistaken, seems to me strong. Tannery
spoke without further argument of ‘le terme 4’homéoméres inventé
par Aristote’ (Science Helline, 15t ed. 286). Of one thing we may
be sure, that Aristotle uses duotopepfi in his own sense, simply as
a descriptive term to denote ‘flesh, bone and other substances of that
order’.</p>

       Selected passages on Anaxagoras’s theory of matter
<p>Aristotle, Meraph.         984ar11: Anaxagoras says the archai are infinite,
for practically all<em> the homoeomers are generated and destroyed as
water or fire are,? by aggregation and segregation alone. They are not
in any other sense generated or destroyed, but last for ever.
  Idem,     Phys.     203a19:       Those     who    make     the elements       infinite in
number, like Anaxagoras and Democritus (the one producing things
from the homoeomers, the other from the totality of seeds of different
shapes), say that the infinite is continuous by contact.                    According to
Anaxagoras, every part is a mixture like the whole, because he saw
everything coming to be out of everything. This seems to be why he
says also that all things were once together: this flesh, this bone, and
similarly anything else; everything therefore, and at the same time,
for there is an original cause of the division not only in each separate
case, but the same for all. For what is generated cotnes into being from
a body of the same kind, and there is generation of all things (though
not at the same time), hence there must also be some original cause of
becoming. It is asingle cause, that which he calls Mind, and Mind begins
its work and thought from a certain starting-point. Hence all things
must have been once together and set in motion at a particular time.
 Idem, GC, 314216: Empedacles posits four elements, or six with the
moving, causes, bur Anaxagoras, Leucippus and Democritus say the
elements are infinite in number. Anaxagoras makes the homoeomers
clements, such as bone, flesh, marrow and whatever else has parts
synonymous3 with the whole, whereas Democritus and Leucippus. . .
(a25) Anaxagoras plainly says the opposite to Empedocles, for
Empedocles claims that the four bodies, fire, water, air and earth, are
elements and are simple rather than flesh and bone and similar homoeo-
mers. Anaxagoras on the other hand says that it is the homoeomers
that are simple and elemental, and earth, fire, water and air are com-~
pounds, being in fact a collection of seeds of the others.
T oysday dmavta in Aristotle. Viastos is probably right in saying that the weakening of the
generality of the proposition may be distegarded. Cornford and Mathewson suppose the mean-
ing 1 be </em> Anaxagoras says in effect that’.

 Idem, De caelo, 302228: Anaxagoras is opposed to Empedocles on
the subject of the elements.              Empedocles’s view is that fire and earth
and the other substances of the same order are the elements of bodies,
and everything is composed of them. According to Anaxagoras, on
the other hand, the homoeomers are elements (Besh, bone, and other
substances of that order), whereas air and fire are a mixture of these and
all the other seeds, for each consists of an agglomeration of all the
homoeomers in invisible quantities. That is why everything is generated
from these two. (He makes no distinction between fire and aizher.)
Idem, Phys. 187a20: Others say that the contratieties were in the
one and are separated out, for example, Anaximander and those who
say that there are one and many like Empedocles and Anaxagéras; for
they too separate other things out of the mixture. The difference be-
tween them is that one makes the process cyclical, the other once for
all, and one posits an infinity of things, the homoeomers and the
opposites, the other only the recognized elements. Anaxagoras’s
assumption of an infinite number appears to have been due to his
acceptance of the universal view of the natural philosophers that nothing
is generated from what is not. That is why they say things like ‘All
things were together’ and ‘To become such-and-such is only altera-
tion”," while others speak of mixture and separation. Another reason
was that the contraries are generated from each other and therefore
must have pre-existed in each other; for if everything which comes to
be is generated either from existing things or from the non-existeat,
and the latter is impossible (all writers on nature agree about that),
they supposed the other alternative to be necessary, namely that things
come into being from things that exist and are already present, but
owing to their minute size are imperceptible to us. For that reason they
say that everything is mixed in everything, i.e. because they saw every-
thing coming into being out of everything; but things look different,
and are called by different names, according to that which predominates
numerically in the mixture of an infinite number of constituents.
Nothing is purely and wholly white or black or sweet or flesh or

be a direct quotation from Anaxagoras, and Ross in his nate on the passage agrees.         But it is
plain from the remarks of Simplicius at 163. o ff. (second paragraph of the next passage translated
here) that the words &amp;Aholwars or Aroiolubor did not oceur in the text of Anaxagoras.</p>

bone, but the nature of each thing appears to be that of which it
contains most,
Simpl. Phys. 162.26: Taking, then, as a prior axiom that nothing
comes to be out of what is not, Anaxagoras seems to have put forward
some such argument as this. What is generated is generated either from
what is or from what is not. It cannot be from what is not, therefore it
must be from what is. But if so, it must pre-exist in that out of which
it has come, for it clearly cannot come in from anywhere outside, when
wasps are generated from horses or vapour from water, Therefore in
the homoeomery there are flesh, bone, blood, gold, lead, sweet and
white, but in quantities too small 1o be perceived by us, all being in
all. For how could everything be seen to be generated from every-
thing (even if through other intermediaries) if everything was not in
everything? But each takes its appearance and is named from that
which most strongly prevails. In truth any given thing is not purely
white or black or sweet or flesh or bone, but everything contains every-
thing and the manifest nature of something is that of which it contains
most. ‘Nothing’, says Anaxagoras, ‘is either generated or destroyed,
but they are mixed and separated from existing things.” Wherefore he
says at the very beginning of his treatise, “all things were together’.
The words “to become such-and-such is only alteration” are said by
Alexander to be aimed at Anaxagoras, because in De gencration: (3143
13] Aristotle finds fault with him for calling aggregation and separation
alteration.   ‘But Anaxagoras’, he says, ‘failed to understand what he
said himself.” At any rate he says [here] that for any kind of thing to
come to be or perish is only alteration; for he [Anaxagoras] did not use
the actual name of alteration in speaking of aggregation and separation.
Porphyry on the other hand refers the words all things were together”
to Anaxagoras, but ‘becoming is alteration’ to Anaximenes and ‘aggre-
gation and separation’ to Democritus and Empedocles. But Anaxagoras
in the first book of the Physica explicitly calls becoming and perishing
aggregation and separation in the words: ‘The Greeks have a wrong
conception of becoming and perishing. Nothing comes to be or
perishes, but there is mixture and separation of things that exist. Thus
they ought properly to call generation mixture and extinction separa-
tion.”   All of these dicta—that all things    were   together, and       that
                             329

coming to be is a matter of alteration or of aggregation and separation
—are meant to confirm the belief thar nothing comes to be out of
what       is not, but things generated                 are generated     from     what     is; for
alteration is of what is, and aggregation and separation are of things
that are.
Arist. at Phys. 187b22 summarizes Anaxagoras’s view thus: If all
such things are in each other, and do not come to be but are there and
are separated out, but are called after that of which there is more, and
anything comes out of anything (for example, water separated aut from
flesh and flesh from water). .
Simpl. Phys. 26.31: Of tho:e who say that the principles are infinite
in number, some make them simple and homogeneous, others com-
pound, heterogeneous and contrary, but characterized by that which
predominates. Thus Anaxagoras son of Hegesibulus of Clazomenae,
after being associated with the teaching of Anaximenes, was the first
to change the doctrine of the principles and supplied the missing cause.
He made the corporeal principles infinite, saying that all homoeomerous
substances like water or fire<em> or gold are ungenerated and indestructible,
but give the appearance of coming into heing and perishing through
aggregation and separation alone; for everything is in everything, but
each is characterized by that which predominates in it. That in which
there is much gold appears as gold, though everything is in it. What ke
actually says is: ‘In everything there is a portion of everything’, and
‘ Those things are and were most plainly each thing, of which there are
most in it.”</em>...‘Looked at in this way,” writes Theophrastus, ‘Anaxa-
goras would appear to make the material principles infinite in number,
and the cause of motion and becoming one, namely Mind; but if the
mixture of all things is regarded as a single substance, indefinite both
in form and in size, which is what he appears to mean3 it results that he
posits two principles, the gpeiron and Mind, and so turns out to be
describing the corporeal elements similarly to Anaximander.’

Simpl. Phys. 460.4 (on Ar. Phys. 203a23): Seeing that Anaxagoras
assumes the homoeomers, and Democritus the atoms as principles,
each making them infinite in number, Aristotle examines the view of
Anaxagoras first and teaches us the reason why he came to this opinion.
He shows that he had not only to call the whole mixture infinite in size,
but also 1o speak of each homoeomer as having everything in it just
like the whole. They are not only infinite but infinite times infinite. To
this view Anaxagoras was brought by his belief that (2) nothing comes
1o be out of the non-existent, and (&amp;) everything is nourished by its
like. He saw (a) that everything comes to be out of everything, if not
directly then serially (as air from fire, water from air, earth from water,
stone from earth, and fire again from stone), and (8) that by taking in
the same food, far example hread, a great variety of things is brought
into being—flesh, bones, veins, sinews, hair, nails, feathers also and
horns in certain cases—and like is nourished by like; wherefore he
supposed that these things are in the food. Similarly, assuming water to
be the nourishment of trees, water contains wood, bark, leaves and
fruit. Hence he said that everything is mixed in everything  and coming-
to-be takes place by separation. With reference to this, perhaps, he also
argued that some things persist when others are generated from them,
as fire from stone and air from bubbling water.
Seeing then everything being separated out from the things which
are now distinct, as flesh and bone and the rest from bread, as if they
were all mixed together in it, from this he concluded that all existing
things were        formerly      mixed     together before they became                 distinct.
Hence he actually began his treatise thus: ‘All things were together’,
so that everything is a mixture just like the All, for example this bread
of this flesh and this bone. From the mixture of each single thing he
arrived at the mixture of all things, for individuals are more manifest
and more cognizable by sensation than are wholes...(461.7). From
what has been said it is easy to see that if everything is separated out
from everything and everything is in everything, not only the All but
each individual thing will be infinite an infinite number of times over,
not only numerically but also in size.’
' If thus means that things must be mfinitely large, st s a careless siatement.   Anaxagoras's
theory was more subtle. (See pp. 289f)</p>

<p>                              Anaxagoras
  Agt. 1.3.5 (446): Anaxagoras son of Hegesibulus of Clazomenae
declared the principles of existing things to be the homoeomers.        It
seemed to him a baffling problem how anything can come into being
out of what is not, or perish into what is not. Yet we take in nourish-
ment which is simple and uniform, bread and water, and from this
nourishment grow hair, veins, arteries, flesh, sinews, bones and the
other parts of the body. Since this happens it must be admitted that
the food which is taken in contains all existing things, and everything
is increased from what exists.   In that food are particles (dépld) which
can produce blood and sinews and bone and the rest—parts which ate
discernible by reason. We must not refer everything to sensation, saying
that bread and water produce these things; rather, there are in bread
and water particles discernible by reason. From the fact that the parts
in the food are the same as what is produced, he called them homoeo-
mers and declared them to be the principles of existing things. The
homoeomers are the matter, and Mind is the creative cause which set
all things in order. He begins thus: ‘All things were together, but Mind
sepatated and set them in order.’
 Simpl. Phys. 155.4: ‘Aristotle adds the opposites in Anaxagoras’s
case,” says Alexander [the reference is to T&amp; e Sporopepf] Kkod T&amp;
tvavrioat 187a25], <em>because the contrarieties are in the homoeomeries
as are all qualitative differences.” Yet in the Empedoclean elements there
are also contrarieties, of hot and cold, dry and wet, heavy and light and
so on, so the words ‘and the opposites’ are equally appropriate 1o
either doctrine; unless it be that the elements contain some contrarieties
but the homoeomers embrace them all at once as they do all qualitative
differences, and on that account the addition is more appropriate to
Anaxagoras. Yet one might say that the elements toc contain all the
opposites, since they are first principles, only not all immediately as do
the homoeomers. Where sweet and bitter are present on the hypothesis
of the elements, they are not in the elements directly, but because of
heat and cold and dryness and wetness, whereas in the homoeomers
they exist primarily and essentially, as also the contrarieties of colour.
Yet even in the homoeomers some contrarieties are prior to others and
the secondary are brought about by the primary. Anaxagoras himself
says in the first book of his Physics: ‘Water is separated off from
                              332
<p>                       Transtation of Passages
clouds, earth from water; and from the earth stones are compacted by
cold, and they move outwards more than water.” His view that
homoeomers infinite in number become separated off from a single
mixture, all things being in everything but each one characterized by
that which predominates, he makes clear by what he says at the be-
ginning of the first book of his Physics:
‘All things were together, infinite both in number and in smallness,
for indeed the small was infinite. And when all things were together,
none was discernible because of their smallness, for air and aither em-
braced ali things, both of them being infinite; for these are the greatest
in the collection of all things both in number and in size.” A little later
he says: ‘ Air and aither become separated off from the mass surround-
ing, and the surrounding is infinite in number.” And a little later: </p>
</em> This
being so, we must suppose that there are many things of all kinds in all
the things that are being mingled, and seeds of all things with every
sort of shapes and colours and flavours.     Before they were separated,’
he says, ‘since all things were together not even any colour could be
discerned. This was prevented by the mixture of all things—the wet
and the dry, the hot and the cold, the bright and the dark, since there
was much earth in it and an infinite number of seeds in no way
resembling each other; for not even any of the other things resemble
each other.’
That nane of the homoeomers is generated or destroyed, but they
are always the same, he makes plain in the words: ‘Now that these
things have been thus separated, it must be recognized that all things
are neither less nor more.   1t is not possible that there should be more
than all, bur all are for ever equal.’
So much for the mixture and the homoeomers.         On Mind he writes
as follows:
The rest have a portion of everything, but Mind is something
infinite and independent, and is mixed with no thing, but alone and by
itself. If it were not by itself, but were mixed with any other thing, it
would have had a share of all things if it were mixed with any, for there
is a portion of everything in everything, as I have said before. And the
things mixed in it would have prevented it from controlling anything
as it can when alone and by itself. It is the finest and purest of all
                              333
<p>                                      Anaxagoras
things, and has all judgment of everything and greatest power; and
everything that has life, both greater and smaller, alt these Mind con-
trols; and it controlled the whole revolution, to make it revolve in the
beginning.     At first it began to revolve in a small part, but now it
revolves over a larger field and will include a larger one still. And the
things that are being mingled and those that are being separated off and
divided, Mind determined them all. Mind set everything in order,
what was to be, what was but is not now,<em> and all that now is and shall
be, and this revolution in which revolve the stars, sun, moon, air and
fire that are being separated off. This revolution caused the separating
off. The dense is separated from the rare, the hot from the cold, the
bright from the dark, the dry from the wet. There are many portions
of many things, and no one thing is completely separated or divided
from another save Mind. Mind is all alike, both the greater and the
smaller. Nothing else is like anything else, but those things are and
were most plainly each thing, of which there are most in it.
That he supposes a twofold ordering, intelligible and sensible, is
clear from the foregoing, and also from this:
‘Mind, which is for ever, is assuredly even now where all other
things are also, in the great quantity surrounding and in the things
which have been brought together and those which have been se-
parated.’
Moreover after the words ‘there are many things of all kinds in all
the things that are being mingled, and seeds of all things with all sorts
of shapes and        colours and       flavours,     and    men    and    the other living
creatures have been formed’, he goes on, ‘and the men have settled?
cities and culdivated fields as with us, and sun and moon and the rest as
with us, and the earth grows all sorts of produce for them, the most
useful of which they gather into their houses for use’.
At 35.8 Simplicius adds the next sentence of the quotation: ‘This
then is my account of the separating off, that it cannot have taken
place only where we are but elsewhere also.’
Simpl.    Phys.     164.13     (on Arist.      187b7fl.):      Anaxagoras         sets out a
number of conclusions or assumptions, each of which, as it seems to me

(or almost all), Aristotle now proceeds to counter. That the principles
were infinite he says right at the beginning: ‘All things were together,
infinite both in number and in smallness’, and that there is neither a
smallest nor a largest among the principles: ‘ Of the small’, he says,
‘there is no smallest, but always there is something smaller; for it is
impossible that what is should not be. Similarly there is always a larger
than the large, and it is numerically equal to the small.      In relation
to itself everything is both large and small.’ For if everything is in
everything, and everything is separated out from everything, even
from that which seems smallest something smaller than it can be sep-
arated out, and what seems largest has been separated out from something
larger than itself. He says explicitly: ‘ Everything contains a portion of
everything else except Mind, and some things even contain Mind’; and
again: ‘the rest have a poriion of everything, but Mind is something
infinite and independent and is mixed with nothing.’         Elsewhere he
says: ‘And since both the large and the small have portions equal in
number, in this way too everything must be in everything. Separate
existence is impossible, but everything has a portion of everything.
When it is impossible for there to be a smallest, nothing can become
separated or by itself, but just as in the beginning, sonow also all things
are together. Everything contains many chings, the larger and the
smaller containing an equal number of the things which are being
separated off.’
Anaxagoras also believes that each of the perceptible homoeomers
comes into being and acquires its character from an aggregation of
similars.      He writes: ‘ Those things are and were most plainly each
thing, of which there are most in it.” He seems to say too that Mind
tries   to   separate   them    but   cannot,</p>
<p>In combating such assumptions of Anaxagoras, Aristotle starts by
contradicting the assertion of an infinite number of principles.
Ihid. 166. 10: Anaxagoras, by making his principles infinite not only
in number but also in kind, must accept the unreasonable consequence
which seems to follow, that the products of these principles also are
unknowable,

is a part, will be of corresponding size. But it is of such homoeomerous
substances, according to Anaxagoras, that animals are composed, and
into them they are resolved, for in his view there is nothing more
ultimate. Therefore their size too is limited to the point to which it
can increase without abandoning its own kind. If anyone objects
that every magnitude is infinitely divisible and therefore whatever
amount you take there is always a smaller, he must understand that
the homoeomers are not simply magnitudes but already magnitudes
of certain kinds—flesh, bone, lead, gold and so forth—which cannot
be divided 1o infinity and still keep       their specific character.   As
magnitudes, they too are infinitely divisible, but as flesh and bone
they are not.                                              i
Ihid. 35.13: Hear too what he says a little later [Simplicius has just
quoted fr. 4] when he is making a comparison of both [se. the states of
mixture or unity and separation]: <em>...as these things revolve and are
separated off by force and swift movement. It is the swiftness that
exerts the force. Their speed is like that of nothing that now exists in
the world of men, but assuredly many times as fast.’
Ibid. 175.¥x: Anaxagoras said, ‘One thing is not divided or
separated off from another’, because everything is in everything;
and elsewhere, ‘ Things are not cut off with an axe, neither the hot
from the cold nor the cold from the hot’, for nothing exists by itself
in purity.
1bid. 176.17: Anaxagoras however did not say outright, so far as I
know, that Mind tries to separate the homoeomers but it is impossible
for it to do so. He said rather that it is Mind that sets in motion and
makes to rotate and is the cause of all separating out; for after saying
that Mind is the cause of the revolution, he adds, ‘and this revolution
caused the separating off. The dense is separated from the rare, the
hot from the cold, the bright from the dark, the dry from the wet.” It is
a little after this that he goes on, ‘ No one thing is completely separated
or divided from another’. Clearly then when he says ‘the dense is
separated off from the rare’, etc., it is in a different sense from ‘one
thing is not separated off from another’. And when he speaks of
generation from each other, he does not mean from all things (he does
not say that a line is separated off from what is white), but from con-
                              336
<p>                       Translation of Passages
traries, as when he says elsewhere, ‘the things in the one universe are
not separated from one another nor cut off with an axe’.
 Simpl. Cael. 608.24 (after quoting the opening of fr. 1 with its men-
tion of gpeiron and apeira): By apeira he probably meant incomprehen-
sible and unknowable to us. This is shown by the words ‘so that we
cannot know the number of the things being separated off, either
theoretically or in practice’. That he believed them to be finite in kind,
he makes plain; for he says that Mind knows all things, but if they were
literally infinite, they would be altogether unknowable, since knowledge
limits and sets bounds to what is known. ‘Mind knows all things,” he
says, ‘both those that are being mingled and those that are being
separated, both what was to be and what was.™
Simpl. Phys. 300.29: That he uses Mind as an agent of genesis is
plain, seeing that he says becoming is nothing but separation and the
cause of separation is Mind. What Anaxagoras writes is: ‘After Mind
initiated motion, it began to withdraw from all that was moved, and
all that Mind moved was divided. And as motion and division went
on, the revolution caused it to be divided much more.’
  Thid.   178.33   [Empedocles   made    the elements   finite in number,
Anaxagoras infinite,] if indeed Anaxagoras was supposing that the
compounds, and not the simple and archetypal qualities, were elements
when be wrote: “and this revolution caused the separating off. The
dense is separated off from the rare, the hot from the cold, the bright
from the dark, the dry from the wet.’ And a little later: ‘ The dense,
wet, cold and dark collected here where they are now, and the rare, hot
and dry receded to the further region of the aither.” These simplest
archetypes he says are separated off, and other things more complex
than they are, he says, sometimes put together as compounds and some-
times separated off as is earth. He puts it thus: ‘From these things as
they are separated off, earth is compacted; water is separated off from the
clouds, and earth from water, and from the earth stones are compacted by
the cold.” By going back to the simple forms in this way Anaxagoras will
appear to have brought his philosophy of the elements closer to first
principles than Esmpedocles did. Possibly Aristotle and Plato, and the
Pythagoreans hefore them, came nearer to positing completely elemental

<p> Life and range of interests. Qur sources are agreed that Archelaus was
a pupil of Anaxagoras and teacher of Socrates. His association with
Socrates is reported from their contemporary Ion of Chios as well as
occurring in later sources, and the fact that he was the older man gives
us our only information as to his date.” He was an Athenian,? and his
position between Anaxagoras and Socrates acquired a symbolic signifi-
cance: he was called the last of the physical philosophers, owing to the
over-simple assumption in later antiquity that ‘ Presocratic’ philosophy
had been interested in “the nature of things’ whereas Socrates turned it
immediately and completely away from that to the problems of human
life.   Hippolytus for instance writes (1.10) that ‘natural philosophy
lasted from Thales to Archelaus, whose pupil was Socrates’.3
On his writings we have only the statement of the Suda that he
<p>‘composed a physiologia and considered that right and wrong were not
by nature but by convention. He also wrote some other works’.
Nothing has survived, save possibly four words in Plutarch (fr. 1ain
DK), and on the evidence he seems to have been a distinetly minor, and
probably not very clear thinker. The reference to right and wrong may
 * Wilamowite (Glaube, 2.212) takes Phutarch’s statement that he composed a poem for Ctmon
<p>{Cim. 4) as an indication both of his date and of the fact thac he belonged to che ‘vornehme
Geselischaft’. On the credentials of Plutarch’s statement cf. Heinimann, Nomas u. Physis, 112,

 * The variant ff MiMioios oeenrs only in DL, 2.16 and the Suda. Both retail also the state~
<p>ment that he was the first to bring philosophy from Ionia to Athens, which favours an Jonian
hirthplace for him, In fact this distinction belongs to his teacher Anaxagoras, of whom ps.-Galen’s
Hist., of Philos. says that he ‘came to Athens and interested Archelaus the Athenian in philo-
sophy” (DK, 594 7).
3 The other authorities for the above paragraph are in the short section Goa of DK. Thereis
<p>one report that he succeeded to the school of Anaxagoras at Lampsacus (p. 268 above). The
report of Ton of Chios (D.L. 2.23) is that as a youth Socrates went abroad (&amp;wosnufiom, 2 word
sometimes used of military service) 1o Samos with Archelaus, Burnet (EGP, 358, n. 5) remarked
that if this should refer to the siege of Samos, it is interesting to think of the youthful Socrates
serving against a force commanded by Melissus (p. 101 above). The hypothesis is calmly con-
verted into a certainty by Heinimann (‘er zog im Jahre 441 mut gegen Samos’, N. w. Ph. 112),

be intended to indicate a separate work on ethical matters.                            He was
commonly called ‘ the physicist’, but Sextus (Matk. 7. 14, 46) says that
he pursued both the physical and ethical sides of philosophy, and
Diogenes (2.16) that he “appears to have treated of ethics, for he
philosophized about laws and things fair and just’, adding the statement
about the conventional character of right and wrong.                      The doxography
in Hippolytus (1.9.6, A4) makes it clear that he carried his account of
the origins of the world and kife down to the beginning of human
societies, laws and arts. As a contemporary of the early [Sophists, he
may well have accepted their favourite antithesis between narure and
convention. In view of his comparatively early date, he may even, as
the sentences in Diogenes and the Suda seem intended to imply, have
pioneered it. From the brief indication in Hippolytus, one can imagine
him following the same line as Protagoras in the speech put into his
mouth by Plato: morals and law were not an original gift of nature,
but acquired in course of time and by bitter experience. More than this
one cannot say, but it is useful to be reminded that we are now entering
the ferment of the Sophistic enlightenment at Athens, and it is unlikely
that any Athenian philosopher was left untouched by it.!
Physical principles. The late accounts of his natural philosophy are
<p>in parts obscure. This may be due to faulty tradition and confusion with
Anaxagoras, but the impression is irresistible that while following his
master in many respects, he tried hard also to be original but was in-
capable of doing so successfully. Theophrastus, recorded by Simplicius,
wrote: ‘In cosmogony and the rest he tried to make an original con-
wribution, but posited the same aschai as Anaxagoras.                      Both assume the
homoeomers, making the arckai infinite in number and heterogeneous.’
  Like Anaxagoras he set Mind at the beginning, but he denied its
complete       purity and separateness:              ‘even Mind         contains mixture’
(Hippol. 1.9.1, 44). Mind was the original cause of motion, and, for
one of our witnesses, of combination and separation. But it is nowhere</p>

said that it is a source of order, indeed in the Placita it is expressly
denied the tirle of ‘cosmopoeic’, and Archelaus seems to have been
even more open than Anaxagoras to the charge of leaving the making
of the universe to the casual interplay of mechanical natural forces.<em>
  Although he used the same archai as Anaxagoras (in Hippolytus’s
version, ‘described the mixture of matter as Anaxagoras did, and the
archat likewise”), he also said that the erche or element is cer ‘and its
condensation and rarefaction’. So Aétius, from whom we also have the
brief and surprising pronouncement that he “called aer and Mind the
God’, and another that ‘the cosmos arose from heat and animation’.?
One can only suppose that, seeing certain affinities between Anaxa-
goras and earlier lonian thought, particularly Anaximenes, he tried to
bring them even closer by abandoning the pure aloofness of Mind and
explaining the animate, self-moving aer of Anaximenes as a mixture of
Mind and matter—going right back, in fact, to the naive hylozoism of
Anaximenes fr. 2, with its identification of aer and life (psycke). To
identify ger with the original ‘all things rogether” was easy, when
Anaxagoras himself had said that at this stage ‘ aer-and-aither embraced
all things’ (fr. 1, pp. 204f. above). That this is what Archelaus did is
the most reasonable conclusion from the doxographers, but although
they are seldom models of accurate interpretation, their inconsistency
in this case is so excessive as to make one suspect that it goes back to
a certain confusion in Archelaus himself. Besides the definite statement
that the arche and element is aer, we are told that the archai are hot and
cold, or that hot and cold are the two causes of coming-to-be, that the
arche of motion is the separation of hot and cold from each other, and
ance that the erche of everything is earth!3

Cosmogony. The original mixture, we may conclude, resembled a
<p>dark mist, and from            this the hot and          the cold were the first to be
separated out, as from Anaximander’s apeiron but by Anaximenes’s
process of condensation and rarefaction, This is essentially a repetition
of Anaxagoras (p. 301 above). They took the form of fire and water
(Aét. 1.3.6, A7). The water, ‘melted’ by the hot, flowed to the centre,
and by further cooling condensed into earth.” The earth is ‘mastered’
(kept in position) by the air, and the air in turn by the revolution of the
fire outside it. Thus the earth is at rest in the centre (for it is a property
of the hot to move and the cold to stay still), and is a very small part
of the whole.?                                                         '
 The air (not the original air, but that produced by the ‘fire-process’,
<p>i.e. presumably by the action of heat from the water condensed out of
the primal air), as it is further burned up, becomes the stars, of which
the sun is the largest, the moon second, and the others of varying sizes.
They are described in the words of Anaxagoras as fiery lumps of stone
(Agt. 2.13.6, a15). Before the tiling of the heavens the sun did not
shine upon the earth: only afterwards did the sun give it light, dry it
up, and make the air transparent.3 Earlier the earth was a watery swamp,
high round the rim and hollow in the middle. This concavity explains
* This is supported by the only words which may be a direct quotation from Archelans:
<p>“coldness is the bond of the earth’, or that which holds it together (Plut. De primo frig. 954f,
fr. 1a). Itis here, however, that our sources, or Archelaus himself, show the greatest confusion.
D.L. 2.16 is corrupt, but at Jeast agrees with Hippolyts thar water changes not only into earth
but also into aer, which, cosmogonically speaking, 1s unnecessary since aer was there at the
beginning. Of course once the cosmos was formed, evaporation coatinues to take place so that
some water is continually changing back into vapour. Hippolyrus says that the water becomes
not only air but also earth ‘by being burned”. txépsvoy 18 66wp (Hippol. 1.9. 2, 44) apparently
means “came into being by the melting (of something else)’, a curious use of the word.    At Plato,
Tim. 49¢, water is more naturally said Tixecba when ir dissolves into air.

  3 So Hippol. x.9.4. Originally, says Zeller (ZN, 1274), the stars ‘ revolved sideways round the
earth, which therefore lay in continuous shadow behind its raised rim®. So also Dimmler,
Akademika, 106: before the #wikhiots the sun, circling round the horizon, was invisible on
account of the raised edges of the earth, and the earth was dark and miry. Anaxagoras with his
flat eaxth is supposed by Zeller to have drawn the opposite conclusion when he said the same thing,
namely that the cosmos became inclined relatively to the earth at a late stage of the creative
process (p. 305, n. 2 above): he brought animals to hife before this event <em> because the sun could
still ched its influence continuously on the earth” (ZN, 1247 n.).

why the sun does not rise and set at the same time in different parts of
the inhabited world. It represented a departure from Anaxagoras, but
was adopted by Democritus.!
Living creatures. There are two accounts of what Archelaus said
<p>about the origin of animal life:
  (a) D.L. 2.17: He says that the animals were born from the earth when it
was warm, and it sent up an ooze resembling milk to serve as nourishment:
it produced men in the same way.
(8) Hippol. 1.9.5 (a4): Concerning animals he says that when the earth
<p>grew warm fiest of all in its lower part, where hot and cold were blended,
many kinds of animals appeared, including man. All had the same diet, being
nurtured on the ooze, and they were short-lived. Later on they were en-
gendered from each other.
The origin of animals and men from the earth, under the action of
<p>heat, reflects once again a very old belief which had already been
rationalized by several philosophers, including Anaximander and
Empedocles (pp. 59, 200, 207 above). Moisture as well as heat is
necessary, and though that is not mentioned in these brief statements
we know       that for Archelaus the earth started as a swamp                         or lake
(Aipvn).    The analogy between the procreative earth and a human
mother was taken seriously,? and here it is carried a stage further in that
the earth provides a milky fluid to nourish its offspring. This is the
first appearance of this strange notion, which was taken up later by the
Epicureans.3
Archelaus copied Anaxagoras in saying that Mind is present in all
<p>animals alike, though some are slower and others quicker to use it
(Hippol. 1.9.6). Theophrastus did not think his theories of sense-
perception worthy of mention in his own history of the subject, so
they were probably not original. We know nothing of them except

for the erroneous statement in Diogenes (2.17) that he ‘was the first
to say that sound is produced by concussion of the air’.
Conclusion. Archelaus was a pupil of Anaxagoras who accepted his
<p>teacher’s theory of matter, but, it would seem, said little about it and
concentrated on the dev<lopment of the cosmos from the hot and cold
which first separated out from the original eer-like mass and might be
considered as the archai of the present world. It is natural that he should
have passed quickly over the “homoeomerous’ theory of matter, since
that had been dealt with in masterly fashion by its originator and could
only have been coarsened in the hands of his less gifted pupil.
   In his cosmogony he carried further the tendency to hark back 10
earlier Tonian models wherever possible. This appears for instance in
his abandonment of the purity and aloofuess of Mind, and in his
Anaximenean theory of the heavenly bodies as produced from air by
rarefaction, in contrast to his master’s idea that they had been forcibly
torn from the earth and ignited by the whirling of the heavens.
   He carried his speculations down to the origins of human society,
laws and arts, right and wrong. If it is true that in this part of his
work he deserves to be singled out as the original formulator of the
convention—nature antithesis, and the statement that right and wrong
are a matter of convention and have no place in the nature of things,
that is perhaps his best claim 1o fame. It was the favourite catchword
of Athenian thought in the second balf of the fifth century, and the
chief bone of contention between the Sophists on the one hand and
Socrates and Plato on the other.!
   * Some scholars have detected a strong influence of Archelaus on contemporary and later
medical writers, e.g. Petron of Aegina and the 7. Sk, The point of comparison is the
assumption of rwo elemenral substances, the hot and the cold. See ZN, 1276, n. 3 and references
there, especially Fredrich, Hippokr. Unters. 129, 135 ff. Euripidesis also supposed to have followed
him in this dualism (Nestle, Euripides, 1581.). A more adventurous account than that here given
of Archelaus’s philosophical character and achievements may be found in Lammil’s Chaos gum

    PHILOSOPHY                          IN THE SECOND HALF
         OF THE                          FIFTH CENTURY
In Archelaus we have found united the two strands of cosmogonical
speculation and ethical and sociological theory. It is a good moment
to pause and consider the relations of these two spheres of interest at
this juncture in the history of Greek thought. The term Presocratic’
is commonly used to cover all the ‘physical” philosophers of the sixth
and fifth centuries, as opposed to Socrates himself and the Sophists as
well as to later thinkers.* This goes with the traditional view that up
to a certain point of time the interest of serious thinkers was centred in
the world of external nature, cosmogony and cosmology with animal
and plant life in its physical aspect, and that at this point a change in
the climate of thought took place.                   Man replaced the universe as the
focus of interest, moral and political theory was developed while
natural philosophy dropped into the background. It was a matter of
chronological succession, and the shift was in large measure due to
one man, Socrates. This view takes its origin from Aristotle, who with
alave of tidiness and system less appropriate to his historical than to his
logical pronouncements, said roundly that with Socrates the investiga-
tion of nature ceased, and philosophers turned their attention to practical
and political excellence; but it goes further back, to the autobiographical
passage in Plato’s Phaedo, which describes the disillusionment with
physical investigations as taking place in Socrates’s own mind.?
  ' Diels-Kranz acmally inchude a number of fourth-century figures, as well as the Sophists, in
the Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, In the preface, Kranz explains the principle that underlies the
book, *Presocratic’is intended to mean, not (as it is often taken)‘ before Socrates’, but* before the
Socratics’. Ttsunityliesin the presentationof a philosophy (the singular, rather surprisingly,is used)
‘which has not been through the school of thought of Socrates and Plato, It gives in fact the non-
Socratic, rather than the pre-Socratic part of ancient philasophy, and its character is determined
by content rather than chronology. Without this explanacion the title is somewhat misleading.
  “ Arist. Part. an. 642a28; Plato, Phasds, g6af. (CE. Arist. Metaph. o87b1.) Some weight
should alse be allowed to passages in Xenophon like Mem. 1.1.11-16, 4.7.5. Such opinions
taken together rule out the idea that Socrates’s abandonment of science for ethics was a ‘later
view' which may be credited to Panaetius. It was of course made much of in Hellenistic times.

                     The Second Half
                                   of the Fifth Century
    Though not devoid of truth, this thesis in its simple form tends to
give a false impression of the sequence of events in the latter part of the
fifth century. It also perhaps does less than justice to the interlocking
of microcosm and macrocosm, the interpretation of the universe in
terms of human relations, which can be detected even in earlier thinkers.
Foremost was the concept of diké, justice, whether as abstract prin-
ciple or powerful goddess.                Anaximander saw it at work in the great
cosmic processes. In Heraclitus it guarded the measures of 'r_lfae sun’s
course and was identical with the cosmic strife on which the existence
of the world depended, as well as being powerful against' human
sinners. The same is true of nomos, law, a single divine ordinance
governing man and the world alike.! For Parmenides it is Diké who
forbids the coming into being or perishing of anything, Xenophanes
was more openly interested in human affairs, and to quote Jaeger again,
his “daring attempt to found human areté on the knowledge of God
and the universe did actually establish an immanent connexion between
cosmological science and education’.                     In the Italian tradition the con-
nexion was even more obvious and essential. The Pythagoreans studied
the cosmic order for the purpose of reproducing its harmonies in the
individual soul and in society. The use made of the word kosmos itself
is an integral part of this. It should not be overlooked that in addition
to its other uses,? it had an established political significance in the fifth
century. When            Herodotus         speaks of the Lycurgan constitution of
Sparta, and Thucydides of a Boeotian party which wished to change
the constitution to a democracy, or of an oligarchic constitution, the
noun they use is kosmos.3
   There are then certain considerations which forbid one to speak of
a change among philosophers in the fifth century from an exclusive
interest in the physical world to a concern for human affairs. Yet an
intellectual revolution took place all the same. Even in the use of diké
  * “Only Heraclitus was a great enough thinker to canstruct upon one single principle a theory
of the cosmos under the government of law, which included man as an essential part of i,

                     A New Spirit of Humanism
by an Tonian like Anaximander, and still more in Heraclitus and the
Western Greeks Parmenides and Empedocles, one can detect religious
overtones inherited from a mythopoeic past. Parmenides, Xenophanes
and Empedocles were themselves poets and heirs of the poetic tradition.
This was a tradition steeped in ethical as well as religious lore, the tradi-
tion of Solonand Theognis, going back to Homer and Hesiod. The new
spirit which we meet in fifth-century Athens is one of conscious reaction
against religion, of humanism in the full sense. It sees human nature as
autonomous, and the existence of higher powers either as doubtful or
frankly as aman-made fiction. At the same timethe gnomic wisdomofthe
poets is being transformed into systematically argued ethicaland political
theory. This is the revolution in which the Sophists took a leading part.
    As to chronology, the table given on p. 348 yields a few interesting
facts which are sometimes forgotten. Many of the dates are only
approximately known, but if we confine ourselves to decades we may
speak with some confidence. Where there is a chance of being correct
to within a year or two, the most likely date is mentioned in brackets.
It emerges that the most influential of the Sophists, Protagoras and
Gorgias, were almost exact contemporaries of Empedocles and Anaxa-
goras, older than Zeno of Elea and Archelaus, and 3040 years older
than Democritus. Prodicus too was older than Democritus, and
roughly contemporary with the Eleatic philosopher Melissus. Exactly
when these men wrote their works is even more difficult to determine
than the dates of their births and deaths, but we must evidently allow
for an influence not only of the ‘physicists’ on the Sophists (which is
universally recognized), but also in the reverse direction. We are deal-
ing with contemporaries, who read each others’ works and were in
many cases personally acquainted.
   The common meeting-ground was Athens. Only Socrates and
Archelaus were natives of the city, but the Athens of Pericles was an
intellectual magnet of extraordinary power. Here the youthful Socrates
could sharpen his wits against Parmenides and Zeno about the year
450. Anaxagoras from Clazomenae spent some thirty years there.
Socrates read his book and was taught by his pupil Archelaus. Prota-
goras set up as a protessional teacher and praciised there for more than
ten years.   He was entrusted by Pericles with the legislation for his

 PHILOSOPHY                          IN THE SECOND HALF
      OF THE                          FIFTH CENTURY
<p>In Archelaus we have found united the two strands of cosmogonical
speculation and ethical and sociological theory. It is a good moment
to pause and consider the relations of these two spheres of interest at
this juncture in the history of Greek thought. The term Presocratic’
is commonly used to cover all the ‘physical” philosophers of the sixth
and fifth centuries, as opposed to Socrates himself and the Sophists as
well as to later thinkers.<em> This goes with the traditional view that up
to a certain point of time the interest of serious thinkers was centred in
the world of external nature, cosmogony and cosmology with animal
and plant life in its physical aspect, and that at this point a change in
the climate of thought took place.                   Man replaced the universe as the
focus of interest, moral and political theory was developed while
natural philosophy dropped into the background. It was a matter of
chronological succession, and the shift was in large measure due to
one man, Socrates. This view takes its origin from Aristotle, who with
alave of tidiness and system less appropriate to his historical than to his
logical pronouncements, said roundly that with Socrates the investiga-
tion of nature ceased, and philosophers turned their attention to practical
and political excellence; but it goes further back, to the autobiographical
passage in Plato’s Phaedo, which describes the disillusionment with
physical investigations as taking place in Socrates’s own mind.?
  ' Diels-Kranz acmally inchude a number of fourth-century figures, as well as the Sophists, in
the Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, In the preface, Kranz explains the principle that underlies the
book, </em>Presocratic’is intended to mean, not (as it is often taken)‘ before Socrates’, but* before the
Socratics’. Ttsunityliesin the presentationof a philosophy (the singular, rather surprisingly,is used)
‘which has not been through the school of thought of Socrates and Plato, It gives in fact the non-
Socratic, rather than the pre-Socratic part of ancient philasophy, and its character is determined
by content rather than chronology. Without this explanacion the title is somewhat misleading.
  “ Arist. Part. an. 642a28; Plato, Phasds, g6af. (CE. Arist. Metaph. o87b1.) Some weight
should alse be allowed to passages in Xenophon like Mem. 1.1.11-16, 4.7.5. Such opinions
taken together rule out the idea that Socrates’s abandonment of science for ethics was a ‘later
view' which may be credited to Panaetius. It was of course made much of in Hellenistic times.

<p>                     The Second Half
                                of the Fifth Century
 Though not devoid of truth, this thesis in its simple form tends to
<p>give a false impression of the sequence of events in the latter part of the
fifth century. It also perhaps does less than justice to the interlocking
of microcosm and macrocosm, the interpretation of the universe in
terms of human relations, which can be detected even in earlier thinkers.
Foremost was the concept of diké, justice, whether as abstract prin-
ciple or powerful goddess.                Anaximander saw it at work in the great
cosmic processes. In Heraclitus it guarded the measures of 'r_lfae sun’s
course and was identical with the cosmic strife on which the existence
of the world depended, as well as being powerful against' human
sinners. The same is true of nomos, law, a single divine ordinance
governing man and the world alike.! For Parmenides it is Diké who
forbids the coming into being or perishing of anything, Xenophanes
was more openly interested in human affairs, and to quote Jaeger again,
his “daring attempt to found human areté on the knowledge of God
and the universe did actually establish an immanent connexion between
cosmological science and education’.                     In the Italian tradition the con-
nexion was even more obvious and essential. The Pythagoreans studied
the cosmic order for the purpose of reproducing its harmonies in the
individual soul and in society. The use made of the word kosmos itself
is an integral part of this. It should not be overlooked that in addition
to its other uses,? it had an established political significance in the fifth
century. When            Herodotus         speaks of the Lycurgan constitution of
Sparta, and Thucydides of a Boeotian party which wished to change
the constitution to a democracy, or of an oligarchic constitution, the
noun they use is kosmos.3
There are then certain considerations which forbid one to speak of
<p>a change among philosophers in the fifth century from an exclusive
interest in the physical world to a concern for human affairs. Yet an
intellectual revolution took place all the same. Even in the use of diké
  <em> “Only Heraclitus was a great enough thinker to canstruct upon one single principle a theory
of the cosmos under the government of law, which included man as an essential part of i,

  <em> Hdt. 1.65, Thuc. 4. 76, 8.72. The close connexion between this and the more general sense
of “order” is bronght out by the use in Plato, Proz. 332¢c. In Cretan cities the highest magistrates
were called kéopor and the singular was used collectively to mean ‘the government’ (RE, x1,

<p>                     A New Spirit of Humanism
by an Tonian like Anaximander, and still more in Heraclitus and the
Western Greeks Parmenides and Empedocles, one can detect religious
overtones inherited from a mythopoeic past. Parmenides, Xenophanes
and Empedocles were themselves poets and heirs of the poetic tradition.
This was a tradition steeped in ethical as well as religious lore, the tradi-
tion of Solonand Theognis, going back to Homer and Hesiod. The new
spirit which we meet in fifth-century Athens is one of conscious reaction
against religion, of humanism in the full sense. It sees human nature as
autonomous, and the existence of higher powers either as doubtful or
frankly as aman-made fiction. At the same timethe gnomic wisdomofthe
poets is being transformed into systematically argued ethicaland political
theory. This is the revolution in which the Sophists took a leading part.
 As to chronology, the table given on p. 348 yields a few interesting
<p>facts which are sometimes forgotten. Many of the dates are only
approximately known, but if we confine ourselves to decades we may
speak with some confidence. Where there is a chance of being correct
to within a year or two, the most likely date is mentioned in brackets.
It emerges that the most influential of the Sophists, Protagoras and
Gorgias, were almost exact contemporaries of Empedocles and Anaxa-
goras, older than Zeno of Elea and Archelaus, and 3040 years older
than Democritus. Prodicus too was older than Democritus, and
roughly contemporary with the Eleatic philosopher Melissus. Exactly
when these men wrote their works is even more difficult to determine
than the dates of their births and deaths, but we must evidently allow
for an influence not only of the ‘physicists’ on the Sophists (which is
universally recognized), but also in the reverse direction. We are deal-
ing with contemporaries, who read each others’ works and were in
many cases personally acquainted.
The common meeting-ground was Athens. Only Socrates and
<p>Archelaus were natives of the city, but the Athens of Pericles was an
intellectual magnet of extraordinary power. Here the youthful Socrates
could sharpen his wits against Parmenides and Zeno about the year
<ol>
<li>Anaxagoras from Clazomenae spent some thirty years there.
Socrates read his book and was taught by his pupil Archelaus. Prota-
goras set up as a protessional teacher and praciised there for more than

Herodotus and probably Empedocles.”
 Democritus the atomist, from the same northern city as Protagoras,
<p>also came to Athens and according to one source spent several years
there.&gt; Gorgias was sent to Athens in 427 at the head of an embassy
from his native Leontini in Sicily, and his oratory made a tremendous
impression. Besides being the leading orator of the day, he knew and
adopted the theories of sensation taught by his fellow-islander Em-
pedocles, and was capable of writing an exercise in Eleatic logic. It is
unlikely that his official embassy to Athens was his only visit. Prodicus
and Hippias talked with Protagoras and Socrates in Athens shortly
before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War. Prodicus, says Plato,
frequently came there, and Hippias more than once. There is no record
of a visit to Athens by Diogenes of Apollonia, but his views were well
known to Euripides and Aristophanes. These and other Athenian
writers of the time, like Saphocles and Thucydides, and Herodotus
who came 1o Athens and settled in its colony Thurii, bear witness to
the wide dissemination of the ideas both of the natural philosophers
and the Sophists. Aristotle indeed said rather unkindly of Empedocles
that he was more of a natural scientist than a poet (Poet. 1447b19).
  ' Morrison says (CQ,      1941, §) that Empedacles attended the actual foundation ceremonies.
Presumably this depends on the evidence of the contemporary poet Glaucus thar he went to
Thurit vswoti wovTrds scnaptvous (D.L. 8.52), which may however mean that his visit was
very soon after, rather than at, the foundanion. On acnon and reaction between thinkers of this

<p>                    The Second Half of the Fifth Century
A striking instance of the error of supposing that the era of cosmo-
<p>logical and physical speculation was entirely prior to the humanism of
Socrates and the Sophists is provided by the relation of Democritus
10 Protagoras. Democritus, ‘un Presocratico in ritardo’ as Alfieri
rather happily calls him, mentioned Protagoras (D.L. 9.42), indeed
attacked and “wrote persuasively and at length’ against his subjective
theory of knowledge (Plut. Colot. 1109a). Sextus couples him with
Plato in this activity, and with the fact assured, one can f?el justified
in taking his assertion that ‘for all men the same thing is godd and true’
(fr. 69) as directed intentionally against this subjectivity.” Similarly his
high moral precept (fr. 264) that ‘one should feel shame before oneself
no less than before others, and behave no more wickedly if no oneis
going to know about it than if everyone is” sounds like a deliberate
rebuttal of the immoralist idea of Antiphon and Critias that the only
reason for not doing wrong is the fear of being found out.
One reason why one cannot speak of humanism as simply replacing
<p>natural science is that the interests of both t0 a considerable extent
overlapped. Some of the Sophists were polymaths who included
astronomy and other special subjects in their instruction.                         Conversely
Democtitus, chiefly known now for his atomic theory of matter, wrote
extensively on ethics. There was no dividing line between ‘nature’ and
‘man’, as was particularly evident in Archelans. Cosmologists had
always included in their speculations the origin of animat and human
life. It seemed a part of the same continuous story to theorize about the
beginnings of civilization and the arts, and one’s views on the origin of
social and potitical institutions decisively colour (or are coloured by)
one’s conception of their nature and use at the present day.                           Specula-
tions of this uhiversal scope may go right back o Anaximander, and
it was certainly assumed by Anaxagoras, as Vlastos puts it, that ‘civi-
lization is a cosmic episode’.* So it happens that the account of the
origin of the useful arts, of societies and of morality which Plato puts</p>

<p>        Links between Physical and Humanistic Philosoply
into the mouth of Protagoras, the Sophist who despised useless know-
ledge and claimed to teach the political art, is paralleled in Demacritus
and in the cosmology preserved by Diodorus.                           His point that the
physical snperiority of the beasts is outmatched by the intelligence of
man recurs in Anaxagoras (fr. 21b). Democritus on the other hand,
also interested in the origin of the arts, attributed them to observation
and imitation of the animals: the spider taught us weaving, the swallow
housebuilding,          Accounts of the origin of the arts, with the emphasis
on human intelligence, are put into the mouths of their characters by
all three tragedians.
 That is one link between physical and humanistic philosophy at this
<p>time. Another is the word physis (‘nature’) itself. The Ionian scientists
had used it in a general sense, for the sum-toral of reality, or its origin
and present constitution; but of course it had also been applied from
an early date to the constitution or form of particular things or species,
like the plant moly in the Odyssey.<em> In the fifth century it began
to be used especially of Auman nature, and in the plural, of the nature
of individual human beings. We read in Euripides of ‘the natures of
mortals’.    ‘Such naiures’ (as thar of Oedipus), says Creon in the
Oedipus Tyrannus, ‘are a burden to themselves’. In Aristophanes we
hear of ‘learning of oneself, without a teacher, from a clever nature’,
which is closely matched by Thucydides’s characterization of Themisto-
cles as ‘displaying a remarkable power of plysis’ because he reached
sound conclusions ‘by his native wit without learning’. Physis as in~
born genius was already contrasted with Jearning by Pindar.3 This
application of the word to human nature, and particularly to its distine-
tive characteristic of intelligence, is described by Jaeger (Paideia, 1,
303) as ‘a momentous departure.. . . The concept of physis was trans-
ferred from the whole universe to a single part of it—to mankind.’
To speak of a transfer from whole to part is an exaggeration. Ever
since Homer the word physis had been used of a single thing or species
as well as of the whole universe. (Parmenides wrote of the pAysis of
  </em> Aesch. P.V. 442f5, Bur. Suppl. 201 ., Soph. ne. 332f. For a parallel berween the Dio-
doran account and Archelaus see p. 343, n. 3 above, and for further details Guthrie, In the Begin-

the moon.) This was so common that ‘the physis of something’ need
be no more than a periphrasis for the thing itself, as when Oedipus
tells Teiresias that he would move a rock to anger (literally ‘the piysis
of a rock’; 0.7. 334£.), and it would be stxange if it were not applied
to human nature along with the rest.
   It is true, however, that at this time the study of human nature was
receiving an increasing amount of attention. This process was assisted
by the Hippocratic treatment of man as a physical organigm.t ‘The
nature of man’ and ‘human nature’ are both Hippocratic phrases, the
latter occurring in the treatise of which the former is the title. It was
also used as a title by Diogenes of Apolionia and Democritus. To undes-
stand and cure diseases it was essential to be familiar both with the
physis of man in general and with the various physeis of individual
patients. Zpidemics 1 says that in diagnosis swe learn *from the common
physis of all and that peculiar to each individual’, Epidemics v1 that
‘natures’ are the real physicians; nature finds ways for herself and does
what is necessary without instruction. According to De humoribus,
different natures do better in diffetent climates and places. Anaphorism
says that diseases are lcss dangerous if the physis of the patient suits them,
and De arte speaks of the physis both of the patient and of the disease.
   The individuality of each man’s ‘nature’ was already recognized by
Empedocles (fr. 110.5, p. 352 above), and is repeatedly emphasized
in the Hippocratic corpus. Another example is in Dv flacibus: ‘One
body differs from another, one physis from another, one diet from
another.” To write correctly about regimen (says the treatise on that
topic), ‘ one must first recognize and distinguish the pAysis of every man’.?
Together with Empedocles and the epistemology of Parmenides fr. 16
(p- 67 above), this fits in well with the relativist theory of knowledge of
a Protagoras. The Hippocratic treatises extend through the fifth and
fourth centuries, and the precise date of each is uncertain. But Hippo-
crates himself was roughly contemporary with Socrates (b. 469), and the

  * As faeger (i4id.) also saw, though here again his claim that this is the first recognition of the
fact that the physis of man is a physical arganism’ might be hard to substanciate.

                                  Meanings of physis
doctrines of human nature here quoted evidently belong to the intel-
lectual milieu of fifth-century natural and humanistic philosophy.
Needless 1o say, the more general sense of physis is not lacking: we
find critictsm of those who have written on nature, reference to the
ordering of things by nature, and so forth.!
   This leads to another link between the natural philosophers and the
humanists, namely the contemporary excitement over the question of
the relations between physis and nomos (usage, custom, convention,
law). This will be dealt with fully later on.                       Here one may simply
mention      that in earlier times, law              had been regarded           as immutable
because of divine origin. As Heraclitus said (ft. 114), ‘All human laws
are nourished by one, the divine’. The antithesis between physis as
divine and unalterable, and nomos as man-made and shifting, appears in
the Hippocratic writings.* For the Sophists it was a basic tenet. The
locus classicus is the long papyrus fragment of Antiphon, in which the

Aristophanes, in a play called the Panoptai or Omnmiscients produced
some time before Aristophanes’s Clouds (423 B.C.). The label ‘atheist’
which he commonly bears, and for which no cogent reason is given, may
have stuck to him as a result of the play, for Cratinus is said to have
represented him as irreligious, and we know the harm that was done
to Socrates by a similar characterization in the Clouds.® That he wrote
after Empedocles is reasonably inferred from Aristotle’s note (De an.
405b3) that he criticized those who said that the soul was blood.> </p>

<p>the moon.) This was so common that ‘the physis of something’ need
be no more than a periphrasis for the thing itself, as when Oedipus
tells Teiresias that he would move a rock to anger (literally ‘the piysis
of a rock’; 0.7. 334£.), and it would be stxange if it were not applied
to human nature along with the rest.
It is true, however, that at this time the study of human nature was
<p>receiving an increasing amount of attention. This process was assisted
by the Hippocratic treatment of man as a physical organigm.t ‘The
nature of man’ and ‘human nature’ are both Hippocratic phrases, the
latter occurring in the treatise of which the former is the title. It was
also used as a title by Diogenes of Apolionia and Democritus. To undes-
stand and cure diseases it was essential to be familiar both with the
physis of man in general and with the various physeis of individual
patients. Zpidemics 1 says that in diagnosis swe learn *from the common
physis of all and that peculiar to each individual’, Epidemics v1 that
‘natures’ are the real physicians; nature finds ways for herself and does
what is necessary without instruction. According to De humoribus,
different natures do better in diffetent climates and places. Anaphorism
says that diseases are lcss dangerous if the physis of the patient suits them,
and De arte speaks of the physis both of the patient and of the disease.
The individuality of each man’s ‘nature’ was already recognized by
<p>Empedocles (fr. 110.5, p. 352 above), and is repeatedly emphasized
in the Hippocratic corpus. Another example is in Dv flacibus: ‘One
body differs from another, one physis from another, one diet from
another.” To write correctly about regimen (says the treatise on that
topic), ‘ one must first recognize and distinguish the pAysis of every man’.?
Together with Empedocles and the epistemology of Parmenides fr. 16
(p- 67 above), this fits in well with the relativist theory of knowledge of
a Protagoras. The Hippocratic treatises extend through the fifth and
fourth centuries, and the precise date of each is uncertain. But Hippo-
crates himself was roughly contemporary with Socrates (b. 469), and the</p>

<p>                                  Meanings of physis
doctrines of human nature here quoted evidently belong to the intel-
lectual milieu of fifth-century natural and humanistic philosophy.
Needless 1o say, the more general sense of physis is not lacking: we
find critictsm of those who have written on nature, reference to the
ordering of things by nature, and so forth.!
This leads to another link between the natural philosophers and the
<p>humanists, namely the contemporary excitement over the question of
the relations between physis and nomos (usage, custom, convention,
law). This will be dealt with fully later on.                       Here one may simply
mention      that in earlier times, law              had been regarded           as immutable
because of divine origin. As Heraclitus said (ft. 114), ‘All human laws
are nourished by one, the divine’. The antithesis between physis as
divine and unalterable, and nomos as man-made and shifting, appears in
the Hippocratic writings.* For the Sophists it was a basic tenet. The
locus classicus is the long papyrus fragment of Antiphon, in which the
differences between natural and conventional morality are worked out
in detail, and it is constantly held up in the pages of Plato as the arch-
enemy of his own world-view. In its sophistic form it was a translation
into moral terms of the distinction between appearance and reality
which haunted philosophy since Parmenides. Empedocles said that
though birth and death are unreal, he will conform to nomos by speak-

Aristophanes, in a play called the Panoptai or Omnmiscients produced
some time before Aristophanes’s Clouds (423 B.C.). The label ‘atheist’
which he commonly bears, and for which no cogent reason is given, may
have stuck to him as a result of the play, for Cratinus is said to have
represented him as irreligious, and we know the harm that was done
to Socrates by a similar characterization in the Clouds.® That he wrote
after Empedocles is reasonably inferred from Aristotle’s note (De an.
405b3) that he criticized those who said that the soul was blood.&gt; He
is variously said to be from Samos, Metapontum, Rhegium and Croton,
a mixture with a Pythagorean flavour, and he was probably at one
time a member of the Pythagorean brotherhood, as Iamblichus (on the
authority of Aristoxenus) says.3
Aristotle had a low opinion of him: the ‘cheapness’ or ‘worthless-
<p>ness” (e0téAeia) of his thought makes him unworthy to be included in
the succession of philosophers (Metaph. 984a3); he belongs to the
coarser or more vulgar (popTikatepor) thinkers (De an. 405b1). The
evidence supports this verdict. On the arché of the universe he tried
to revive the oldest theory of all, that of Thales that it was water or
‘the moist’.         He appears, says Aristotle, to have had in mind its genera-
tive power, arguing from the liquid nature of semen.t                           Hippolytus
reports more precise information (Ref. 1.16; DX, A3): water produced,
or gave birth to, fire, which then ‘overmastered its parent’ to form the
cosmos. This would account for other late statements that he posited
two archai, fire and water. It looks like an attempt to conflate early
monism with a theory like that in the Way of Seeming of Parmenides,
' A scholiast on Clouds, 94ff. (DK, az) says that Cratinus had earlier made similar remarks
<p>about Hippon in the Panoptai. The information that he called him &amp;oepris comes from a scholiast
on Clement’s Protrepticus also quoted by DK. Philoponus and ps.-Alex. in their commentaries
on Anstotle (De an. 88. 23 and Meraph. 462.29, DK, A8 and 9) aunbute the ritle ‘atheist’ to
his materialism, but he was by no means alane in this.
* Cf. Empedocles, fr. 105, p. 229 above and Theophr. De sensu, 10 on p. 228. Reiche’s com-
<p>plex argument against this supposition has not convinced me (Emped.’s Mixture, 15).

<p>also variously given.    One remembers that enforced changes of residence were part of the
Pythagorean   lot.
  ¢ Commenting on the Metaphysics passage, Alexander (DK, AG) says that Hippon used the
general term ‘the mowst’ wathour specifying whether he meant water hke Thales or ser like
Anaximenes and Diogenes; but Simplicius (PAys. 23.22, A4) couples him directly with Thales
as speaking of water.

though how water alone (also called ‘ the cold”) could produce fire (‘the
hot’) is not explained.             It is all very well for Simplicius to say that “the
hot lives on the moist” (Phys. 23.24; DK, 11 4 13) in the present world,
but this is only possible because they have always existed together in a
state of parity, as Parmenides saw.
 The universal arché was, as always, the life-substance or psyche.
<p>Hippon said that the psyche was the brain, watery in substance and
arising from the semen, which flows from the marrow.                           For t}ee Greeks
brain and marrow were identical, the brain being a continuation of the
spinal ‘marrow’, and brain and semen had been identified by Alemaeon
and probably more generally.” Into this system Hippon fitted another
Greek commanplace, the association of youth and suppleness with
moisture, old age and death with dryness.</p>
</p>
<p>His view is that there is within us our own moisture, by which we are
sentient and by which we live. When this moisture is in its proper condition,
the living creature is healthy, but when the moisture dries up, it loses sense
and dies. This is the reason why old men are dry and enfeebled in their
senses, namely that they are without moisture. Similarly the soles of
the feet are insensitive hecause they lack muoisture....In another book
the same writer says that the aforesaid moisture changes through excess
of heat and cold, and so brings on diseases. It changes to greater moisture
or dryness or 10 a coarser or finer texture or into other substances, and
so he explains the causes             of disease.      He   does    not    however      name    the
diseases so caused.?</p>

papyrus was in a sorry state at this pownt, and onty the first three letters of Hippon's name are
preserved, but no other is posuble (Dicls, Hermes, 1893, 4z0-1). The author of this passage
calls Hippon a Crotoniate, and if he were at any time an adherent of the Crotoniate medical
school he would naturally know the work of Alemaeon. Alemaeon’s anatomical researches
shawed the ‘passages’ from eye to brain, and he considered the water 1n the lens an essential
instrument of the power of sight.      Diels suggests that Hippon with his more limited intellect
was led into a clumsy generahzation of Alcmaeon’s discovery.       However, the association of life
with moisture was, 1s I have said, a commonplace, and from that 1o halding it responsible for
sensation is surely an casy step.</p>

<p>                          Minor Philosophers: Hippon
On the controversial question of whether both parents contribute
<p>seed in reproduction, on which Empedocles and Anaxagoras had
differed, Hippon made the uninspired suggestion that females produce
seed but it is discharged from the womb and contributes nothing
to the birth,' He also said that the sex of the offspring depends
on the consistency of the semen (A&amp;t and Censorinus, A14).
Another passage of Censorinus represents him as emphasizing the
importance of the number seven in the cardinal stages of human life
in the same       way,    and    almost     in the same        words,     as Alexander         of
Aphrodisias ascribes to the Pythagoreans.                      That the number            ten is
also given special significance certainly does not lessen the case for
his Pythagorean affinities. Like Diogenes of Apollonia and Democritus
he supposed embryos 10 be nourished by sucking a breast-like growth
on the womb           (Cens. 6.3, a17).3            He     also wrote      on botany, and
his remarks on the distinction between wild and cultivated plants are
quoted and criticized by Theophrastus in his Hisroria Planterum
(135, 419).
 A single fragment of his actual writing was discovered in 1885,
<p>quoted by Crates of Mallus (second century B.c.) and repeated in a
scholiast on the Zfiad (DK, 11, pp. 387 £.). It says chae all sweet water
comes from the sea, because the sea is deeper than any well, and what is
at a higher level than the sea must have come from it. Zeller (ZN, 336,
n. 1) thought this showed that Hippon accepted Thales's idea that the
earth floats on water, which no doubt he did. The sea-water is sweetened
by filtering as it rises through the porous earth. This would be the
opposite of what Anaxagoras supposed to happen (p. 311 above). In
any case the fragment is hardly exciting.</p>

to semen mn males (GA, 72733). For Empedocles and Anaxagoras cf. pp. 217, 317 above.
According w© the Placita (5.5.1-3), Pythagoras and Democritus were of Empedocles’s
apnion,
  * Cens. 7.2 (a16): ‘Hippon of Metapontum reckoned that men could be born from the 7th
to the yoth month... . This maturity beginning from 7 months is prolonged until ro because this
is the narural way with everything, that to 7 months or years 3 should be added for the con-
summarion to be reached. Teeth begin for an infant of 7 months and are complete in the rath at
most, 1n the 7th year the first of them fall out, m the toth the last’, ere. CE what Alexander has

<p>                   The Second Half of the Fifth Century
Such interest as Hippon has to offer arises in a left-handed way from
<p>uis lack of distinction and originality, which makes him a mirror of the
current ideas of his time. In particular one may notice once again the
tendency to hark back to the Ionians, the capital importance of heat and
cold,” and the intimate connexion between the universe and the human
body, cosmology and physiology. This parallel between macrocosm
and microcosm pervaded many of the Hippocratic writings too, though
strenuonsly combated in the more empirical and strictly medical treat-
ises, and reaches a height of absurdity in the treatise On Sevens. There
it is said that animals and trees on the earth have a constitition resem-
bling that of the universe: the stony parts of the earth résemble the
bones, what is around them the flesh, rivers the blood in the veins and
so on. The importance of the number seven in human life goes back at
least to Solon, but he would hardly have proceeded to the grotesque
comparison of the Peloponnese to the head (because ‘a seat of high-
minded men), Ionia to the diaphragm, Egypt to the belly and so onup to
seven.? The identification of macrocosm and microcosm, in one form
or another, reaches back to pre-philosophical man. It goes with the
conceprion of the earth as mother, and the idea that the rocks are
her bones is central to the myth of Deucalion. What is fascinating, as
an instance of the persistent dominance over the Western mind enjoyed
by certain basic forms of myth, is to find it flourishing in the full light
of fifth-century rationalism (as it flourished still at the Renaissance),
and to trace the variations of which it was capable in the maunderings
of On Sevens, in a would-be rationalist like Hippon and a superior mind
like Alcmaeon’s.
A few other names of the time may be briefly noticed. Crarylus is
<p>chiefly known for having carried the Heraclitean doctrine of flux to
such an extreme that he was finally led to abandon the use of language
and simply move his finger. In the dialogue called after him Plato
represents him in conversation with Socrates, though he may well have

the opinions of Heraclitus (though not to go beyond him), and to
believe that names have a natural appropriateness to the objects named.
Perhaps, as D. J. Allan has suggested, this represented an earlier stage
of his thought than that to whicl, in Aristotle’s words, he came ‘in the
end’." The views of Cleidermus on sensation are mentioned by Theo-
phrastus between those of Anaxagoras and Diogenes of Apollonia,
which may be a clue to his date, since Theophrastus seems to proceed
in chronological order.* He grants him originality on the subject of
sight, which he said was due solely to the fact that the eyes were trans-
parent. All the senses except hearing were autonomous, whereas the
ears had no power of discrimination themselves hut must remit the
stimulus to the mind.             He said that lightning was oaly an appearance,
like phosphorescence, and he figures in Theophrastus’s botanical works
with remarks on plants, their general nature (composed of the same
clements as animals but more turbid and colder), their diseases, and the
best time to sow. /daews of Himera is grouped by Sextus (Matk. 9.360;
DK, 63) with Anaximenes, Diogenes of Apollonia and Archelaus as
holding that air is the arché. This menton of (presumably) some Goo
years after his time occurs in a skerchy and partly inaccurate list of all
who have posited corporeal elements. (It says that Xenophanes posited
both earth and water as archai, quoting in support the statement of
fr. 33 that “we are all born out of earth and water’.) Nothing else is

Qenapides of Chios is included by Sextus in another list as having
<p>posited two archai, fire and air, and appears in Aétius among those who
said that God was the soul of the world.?                      Presumably therefore he
wrote on cosmology, but we cannot claim to know what he said except
on astronomy. This and mathematics were his special interests.                                His
activity can be approximately dated early in the second half of t}qe fifth
century by (a) a statement of Proclus that he was a little younger than
Anaxagoras, (6) a report that he was a contemporary of Demlocritus
and mentioned by him; and more precisely by (c) the fact that his esti-
mate of the solar year must have preceded that of the astronomer
Meton, which is fixed by its reference to the summer solstice of 432.3
Fudemus is quoted as saying that he discovered the obliquity of the
ecliptic. This is elsewhere credited to Anaximander, and it is difficult
to believe that it could have remained unobserved as a fact until this
date. Probably he calculated its angle. The feat would have been within
his mathematical capacity, and Proclus hints that he valued mathe-
matics as an astronomical tool# The Milky Way, he held, marked a
former path of the sun, which later turned aside to its present course
through the Zodiac. This is a theory which Aristotle attributed to a
section of the Pythagoreans.5             He spoke of a ‘ Great Year” (the shortest

the reference 1o condensation and rarefaction suggests rather Anaximenes, and Anaximander

tary on Euclid that he investigated the problem of drawing a per-
pendicular to a given straight line from a point outside it and discovered
how to construct at a point on a given straight line an angle equal to0 a
given rectilineal angle (Euclid 1.12 and 23).<em> His theory of the Nile
floods was at least original. Subterranean water (as in wells) is warmer
in winter than in summer, therefore it dries up more in winter and flows
more freely in summer. Since (unlike e.g. Greece) Egypt has little rain
winter or summer, this fact accounts for the summer flooding of the
river (Diod.      1.41.1; DK,         131).
These examples, which exclude the men usually known as Sophists,
<p>may help to consolidate our picture of the range of interests of this
intellectually intensely active period. The Sophists included many of
the same subjects in their teaching, along with the human studies of
ethics, politics, linguistics, Others like Meton the astronomer or Hippo-
crates of Chios the mathematician3 specialized in a single branch of
learning. One who, as much as any other, might be called a fashion-
able philosopher of the time was Diogenes of Apollonia, but his ideas
are worth considering by themselves at greater length.

              DIOGENES                     OF        APOLLONIA
<p>As a younger contemporary of Anaxagoras, whose views were parodied
by Aristophanes, Diogenes is in the centre of the intellectual activity
described in the last section, In an attempt to revive monisrh and even
the hylozoism of Anaximenes in a post-Parnenidean age, he made
considerable use of earlier theories, and he had strong physiological and
medical interests. Apart from the heroic effort to reconcile Ionian
monism with contemporary currents of thought, his greatest signifi-
cance lies perhaps in his explicit statement and defence of the teleological
explanation       of nature,’ which            underwent         such remarkable and in-
fluential developments in the hands of Plato and Aristotle.
                                 (1) Life and writings
<p>Diogenes Laertius (9.57) says that he lived in the time of Anaxagoras,
and this is made more precise by the statement of Theophrastus (ap.
Simpl. Phys. 25.1, a5) that he ‘was pretty well the latest of those who
studied these matters [i.e. the physis of things and the problem of
change], and wrote for the most part eclectically, in some things follow-
ing Anaxagoras, in others Leucippus”.<em> Considering the parody of his

</em> F. Huffmeier has argued against this in an atticle ‘ Teleologische Welthetrachtung bei Diog.
Apoll.}<em> m Philologus, 5963. On p. 134 he writes: </em> Es stebt einfach nicht im Text, dass die Ord-
nung der Welc die alrlx of dvexs der Kosmogome            war....Die von Theiler benougte Vor-
aussetzung, dass Diogenes hienin uber Anaxagoras (besonders 59813 nnd 14) hinausging, ist also
nicht gegeben.’ But is it not unreasonable to deny the epithet teleological to the doctrine that an
intelligent being existed prior to the cosmos as arcké, was its efficient cause, ordered it in the best
possible way and is stilt actine in the world? Al thisis in the text. Where Diogenes went beyond
Anaxagoras was in removing Mind from its position of prond but inefficient isolation, ¢ mixed
with no other thing’, and bringing 1t 1nto continuous living contact with the world.
&quot; It might therefore be thonghr more logical to consider Diogenes after the atomists, as KR
<p>do, rather than before them as here. I confess that in choosing the present order 1 have acted
 from a feeling that the atomusts are the climax of Presocratic thought and therefore form the most
fitting conclusion to anaccountof it. So far as Diogenes’s debt to Leucippus isdiscernible from the
evidence, it consisted mainly in theadmissionof void(pp. 367 £. below), and this is not a conception
which should cause difficulty. On the other hand Diogenes probably wrote before Democritus.
The important thing to remember
                         s thatall these thinkers, ineluding Mehssus,
                                                                were contemporaries.
<p>Most scholars would say that both Leucippus and Diogenes wrote with knowledge of the work
of Melissus, yet it has alsa been argued that iis work was a caticism of theirs (p. 368, n. 1 below).
We shall not ge far wiong in thinking of all three as active together n the decade 44030,

with a high degree of probability that he was writing between 440 and
423
Jaeger (TEGP, 165) took the attentions of the comic poets, Aristo-
<p>phanes and Philemon, as proof that he ‘lived for 2 long time in Athens’.
His views seem to have been well known there, but otherwise we have
no clue to the events of his life." It is not even certain where he was
born, for there existed a large number of aities called Apollonia.
Aclian mentions ‘ Diogenes the Phrygian® in a list of ‘atheists’, and
Stephanus of Byzantium (fifth century a.p.) ‘Diogenes the natural
philosopher” as coming from Apollonia in Crete, the former Eleuther-
nae. It is generally supposed that he is “the Phrygian’, and came from
the Milesian colony of Apollonia on the Black Sea.<em>
Of his writings Simplicius gives the following description (Phys.
<p>151.24, DK, 44):
One must know that this Diogenes wrote a number of treatises, as he himself
mentions in the book On Nazure, where he says that he has written something
against the natural philosophers (whom he himself calls sophists), and a
Metesrology (3m winch, he adds, he discusses the mrche), and moreover a
work On the Nature of Man. However, in On Nature, the only one of his
works that has come into my hands, he sets out to demonstrate at length that
in the arche which he posits there is much intelligence.
(Simplicius then proceeds to quotation.) From a second-hand state-
ment in Galen (see Diogenes ft. 9), who frankly admits that bie himsell
has not seen the work, we learn that On Nature contained at least two
books. This is the sum of our information about the number and
nature of his works3 The opening sentence of his “treatise’ (i.e.
' Kahn (.dnaximander, 106) criticizes those who connect the references to air-theotics in
<p>Acistophanes and Euriprdes with Diogenes's supposed visit to Achens, the evidence for which s,
as he says, tenuous; but the familiarity of his views did noc necessartly depend on his pliysical
presence.   On the other hand it 12 possible thar lus influence bas been exaggeiated.     See p 380

and gives his creed as a writer:
1 hold that whoever undertakes an exposition ought to make the starting-
point (or first principle, arcke) indisputable,’ and the explanation simple and
dignified.</p>
  (2) The fundamental thesis: air as the arché of nawure and life
<p>Fortunately for our knowledge of Diogenes, Simplicius pot only
possessed his book On Narure but quotes freely from jt. Apalt from a
highly specialized passage on the veins, all our extracts come 'from the
same place in his commentary on Aristotle’s Physics, and it will be as
well to begin by translating them in their setting in Simplicius’s text.
The passage is an immediate continuation of that just quoted (Phys.
151.28):
Immediately after the introduction Diogenes writes as follows (fr. 2):
  ‘My view is, in sum, thar all existing things are modifications of the same
thing, and are the same thing. This is obvious; for if the things now existing
in this cosmos—earth, water, air, fire and all the other things which mani-
festly exist in this cosmos—if
                          one of these was different from another, differ-
<p>ent, that is, in its own proper nature, and not the same thing changed and
altered in many ways, they could in no way mix with one another, nor affect
one another for good or ill. Not even a plant could grow from the earth, nor
could any animal or anything else come into existence, if everything were
not so constituted as to be the same. But in fact all these things are variatians
of the same thing: they became different ar different times and revert to the
same thing.’
Happening upon these words first, I too thought he meant that be-
<p>sides the four elements there was something else to serve as common
bk, 1 of the . ploess though he thought he had the whole. Simplicius’s statement was defended
by Theiler (Teleol. Naturberr. ) and Burnet (EGP, 353). It is interesting, as Burnet noes, that
Simphicius should have preserved the derail that, where he himsel{ would speak of puoicAdyor,
Dingenes said copicai, reflecting the usage of an earlier day, Kirk sums up the question judici-
ously (KR, 428 {.). He points out that Aristorle’s long extract from Diogenes on the veins (HA,
s11b31) seems 1o giveexactly what Simplicius claims (x53. 18) to have found in On Nature,rather
than caming froma separate wark On the Nature of Man. Nevertheless he quotes a passage
Srom Galen wInch, if the Diogenes there mentioned is our Diogenes, speaks of a separate
treatise by him on medicine. (Walzer's edition of the Arabic version of On Med. Experience,
1944, 22.3)

<p>                                     Air as the Arché
substratum,! seeing that he says the elements would not mingle nor change
into one another if some one of them was the first principle with a nature of
its own instead of the same thing underlying them all, of which they were
all variations, However, he goes straight on to show that this first principle
possesses a high degree of intelligence, ‘for’, he says (fr. 3),
“without intelligence it would not have been possible for a division 1o be
<p>made in such a way as to keep the measures of all things—winter and summer,
night and day, rain, winds and fair weather; and all else too, if one is willing
10 reflect, one will find arranged in the best possible way’;
and then he argues that men and the other animals owe their life, soul and
intelligence to this principle, which is air.              His words are these (fr. 4):
‘Moreover there are in addition these important indications. Men and the
<p>other animals live on air, by breathing, and this is 1o them both soul and
mind, as will be clearly demonstrated in this treatise; and if this leaves them
they die and their mind fails.”
A little after this he goes on plainly (fr. 5):
‘And T hold that that which has intelligence is what men call air. All men
<p>are guided by it, and it masters all things. I hold that this same thing, is
God,? and that it reaches everything and disposes all things and is in every-
thing. There is not one thing that does not have a share of it. Yet no one
thing shares in it just as another does, but there are many forms both of air
itself and of intelligence, for it is muldform—hotter and colder, drier and
wetter, more stable and more swift-moving, and there are many other varia-
  <em> ‘I'too’. Simplicius is refuting the opinion of Nicolaus of Damascus and Parphyry that whea
Aristotle speaks of believers in a basic subsiance separate from all the elements, something </em> denses
than fire but rarer than air’ (PAys. 187 214), he is refernng to Diogenes. That is his purpose 1n
quoting the passages which make it clear that for Diogenes the &amp;px# was in fact air itself. CF. alsa
25.4ff, For Simplicius as a good Aristotelian it seemed natural that any explanation of chaage
should sarisfy the Aristotelian demand for a neutral substrarum distinct from the changing sub-
stances or their qualities (e.g. Arist. Meraph. 106953 1L.).
In spite of Cherniss, 4CP, 54, n. 21, I cannot reconcile these two passages in Simplicius with
<ol>
<li>2—3, where he contrasts Diogenes with Anaximenes as making 7o nete0 the dpx1 as appased
t0 air. He is giving a quick list of examples of monists {Thales water, Heraclitus fire, Anaximenes
air, Diogenes the intermediate body), and since the attriburions are at the moment unimportane,
allows Nicolaus's conjecture to slip in. &amp;g before Thales is almost “as it might be”. (Chemniss
does not even mention Simplicius’s strenuous denial of Nicolaus in two places.) That Simplicius
should seriously have supported Nicolaus in this is all the more unlikely in that Avistotle himself
expressly   couples Diogenes with Anaximenes as making      awe Ao’     doydyv Téiv dridv   awpdrwy

tions and an infinite variety both of scent and colour. Moreover the soul of
all animals is the same thing, namely air, warmer than the air outside in
which we are, but much colder than that near the sun. No animal has the
same heat as any other, nor even one man the same as another, but the
difference is not great, no more than is comparible with their being similar.
None of the things subject to change can become exactly like another, with-
out becoming the same thing.” Since the diflerentiation is multiform, living
creatures are also many and various, not resembling one another either in
appearance or in manner of life or in intelligence, owing to the myltitude of
differentiation. Yet all owe their life and sight and hearing to the same thing,
and get the rest of their intelligence from the same thing.’           i
After this he shows that the seed of animals also is aeriform, and mental
<p>activities® 1ake place when the air with the bload pervades the whole hody
through the veins, in a passage in which he gives a precise anatomical account
of the veins.
In these sentences, then, he says quite plainly thar what men call air is the
<p>arché. 1t is remarkable that while maintaining that everything else is generated
by differentiation from air, he nevertheless calls it eternal, saying (fr. 7):
“and this itself is a body both eternal and immortal, but by it some things
<p>come into being and others perish.”
And elsewhere: “ But this seerns to me evident, thar it is great and strong and
eternal and immortal and knows many things.’
Theophrastus’s statement that Diogenes owed much of his doctrine
<p>to Anaxagoras and Leucippus                    does not of course refer to the two
fundamentals, the choice of primary substance and the process of
generation. It occurs at the end of a rapid review of the monist
philosophers in Simplcius, and he continues (still quoting Theo-

Presoeratic times (noted by Reinhardt, Parmenides, 105). Sambursky, commenting on the

continuum as opposed to atomic physical theory (Phys. of Swics, 47), and that this to0 is in

says that it is infinite and everlasting air, out of which other things rake
shape as it thickens and thins and changes its condition.”
The downright assertion that everything that exists is a modification
<p>of one and the same basic substance, and that substance one of the
recognized elements, is a deliberate invitation to return to earlier modes
of thought and a challenge to contemporary philosophy. To maintain
it, Diogenes had to argue on two fronts: first he must show that recent
attempts to escape the Eleatic arguments         by assuming an ultimate
plurality of elements were unacceprable; and secondly he must himself
meet the Eleatic argument that what was one could never become many.
In fr. 2 he attacks the four ‘roots of all things’, which Empedacles,
<p>in deference 1o Eleatic principles, had assumed to be incapable of
transmutation into one another, and to produce the variety of the
natural world solely by mixture in different proportions. Without an
underlying unity of substance, says Diogenes, to allow of their mumal
transformation, the kind of interaction necessary to produce such
complex organisms as plants and animals could not take place. This diffi-
culty had also been felt by Anaxagoras. Everything that we see exist-
ing, he had said, must have grown out of something identical with it.
His own solution had been to0 extend pluralism to its ultimate limits
with his idea of ‘a portion of everything in everything . The complexity
of the resulting theory was formidable, and Diogenes saw the way out
in a return to the simplest meaning of the hypothesis on which all alike
agreed, that whatever exists, in spite of apparent changes, must remain
essentially what it was: substantial change is inconceivable because it
would mean the actual coming-into-being and perishing of ‘what is”.
The obvious inference from this inescapable Parmenidean tenet, he
said, is not the infinite plurality of the real, but its unity.
Here however he had 1o meet the further consequence of Eleatic
<p>logic, which had made the theory of ultimate pluralism seem inevitable,
namely that there was no means by which a world of change and motion
could be produced from unity. But the stumbling-block here had been
the denial of empty space, which the Eleatics equated with non-being.
Both Empedocles and Anaxagoras had felt bound to accept this, but
Leucippus had already removed it from the path of Diogenes. That he

believed in an infinite void is stated only by Diogenes Laertius (9.57),
but the statement receives strong circumstantial support, and his belief
in the existence of void is vouched for by Aristotle, who explicitly
contrasts him with Anaxagoras in this respect (De resp. 470b 30, p. 379
below). We know from Theophrastus that Diogenes adopted some
of Leucippus’s ideas, and it is impossible that anyone in his day could
fail to be aware that condensation and rarefaction (the process by
which air took on its manifold disguises) demanded void as a pre-
condition. The contemporary Eleatic Melissus drew this tonclusion
explicitly.” If our other authorities for Diogenes do not mention i,
this is probably because in anyone writing after Lencippus and accept-
ing the two facts of change and basic unity, it could be taken for
granted. Had Diogenes noz seen that his system demanded a void,
Theophrastus would probably have criticized him for inconsistency as
he did the Empodoclean theory of ‘pores’. The denial of void is
reported for Zeno, Melissus, Empedocles and Anaxagoras, so that even
the silence of our authorities lends some support to the one definite
statement that Diogenes accepted it. Diogenes was not an atomist, but
he had read Leucippus and agreed with him on two fundamental points:
the material uniformity of all body and the existence of empty space.</p>

<p>A   system     deliberately combining              Ionian     monism       with    the recent
recognition of the concept of void, even though the one came from
Anaximenes and the other from Leucippus, cannot be said to lack all
originality. It was a serious philosophical attempt to rival the fashion-
able pluralistic worlds as a defence of phenomena from Parmenides,
and it is hardly fair to say with Jaeger                 (TEGP, 166) that Diogenes’s
motives for the return to monism were primarily theological. Theo-
logical considerations may, however, have played their part in the
choice of the single arcké. In the course of this history we have more

<p>Hermes, 1941, tried to prove that Melissus wrote later and in criticism of Diogenes, but his argu-
ments, based on verbal similarities, are by no means conclusive (cf. Kirk in KR, 430£.). The two
were contemporaries, and the main point is that no one at this time could have revived the theory
of condensation and rarefaction without recognizing the problem of void, of which its original
author Anaximenes was happily unaware,</p>

<p>               The Existence of Void: Air is Divine
than once had occasion to notice the ancient connexion between air,
life and divinity, which had already been exploited by Anaximenes
(vol. 1, 12771.). This connexion Diogenes developed under the influence -
of Anaxagoras’s concept of Mind as the first cause. It enabled him to
account for the influence of Mind on material events without contraven-
ing his principle that what is essentially different from anything can
have no effect upon it. The aloofness of Mind from the world, as we
saw, had prevented Anaxagoras from fulfilling the hopes of a theo-
logical explanation of nature to which the concept of Mind as first
cause gave rise.
  In Diogenes the theological explanation is paramount. The air from
which all things come is also an omnipresent and omniscient god, whose
conscious wisdom ensures the regularity and order of the cosmos.
(The emphasis on ‘measires’ is probably an echo of Heraclitus.) For
its activity he revived the old word wuBepvdv, ‘guide’ or ‘steer’, a
keyword of the Milesians and Heraclitus, and Parmenides in the Way
of Seeming (vol. 1, 88).   Jaeger (TEGP, 204, 243) has rightly drawn
attention to the traditional religious, even hymn-like character of the
language which Diogenes bestows on the god, once his existence has
been assured on rational grounds. Still developing olderideas, Diogenes
followed Anaximenes and certain religious teachers (vol. 1, 201) in
identifying the divine air in the world with the life-giving principle in
animals and men, which is drawn in with the breath. The air in our
bodies was ‘a small portion of the god” (p. 374 below). We also notice
from fr. 5 the infinite variety of the forms of air and the special import-
ance of differences of temperature. All these variations could have been
ultimately reduced by Diogenes, as heat and cold were by Anaxime.es,
to differences of density; but it sounds as if he paid more attention to
the many derivative changes of quality, as is perhaps implied also in
the words of Theophrastus that things are produced by air, “thickening
and thinning and changing in its qualities (mé@n)’, Finally, it is natural
1o infer from fr. § that the purest form of air, which is sheer intelligence
and God, is warmer than that which gives life and less perfect powers of
cogpnition to the animals and ourselves.</p>

<p>Not much information and no fragments are preserved on these topics,
evidently because Dicgenes was not thought to have contributed much
that was interesting or original. Thus the Stromateis record (A 6):
Diogenes postulates air as the element. Everything is in motion and there are
innumerable worlds. He constructs the cosmos thus: the whole is in motion
and becomes thin in one place and dense in another, and where] the dense
comes together it has formed a close mass,” and $0 on with the test in the
same way: the lightest parts took the uppermost station and produced the
sun.

 From Aétius we have (2.13.5 and 9, a12):
<p>Diogenes says that the stars are like pumice-stone, and he regards them as
the breathing-holes of the world. They are fiery. With the visible stars
revolve stones which are invisible, and for that reason nameless. They often
fall on the ground and are extinguished, like the stone star that came down
on fire at Aegospotami.</p>
</p>
</p>
 Aétins alsn reposts that the sun js pumice-like, ‘and the rays from
<p>the aither are fixed in it’. This suggests a combination of Empedocles’s
sun, which was purely a concentration of light-rays, and the ‘fiery
stone’ of Anaxagoras. It is quenched (every night presumably; we are
not told) by cold attacking the heat. The moon also is an ignited mass
of pumice-like material. (A&amp;t 2.20.10, 25.10; DK, a13 and 14.)
‘Comets are stars’ (Aét. 3.2.8, A15), no doubt a condensed expression
of the same view that Anaxagoras held, that they are chains of planetary
bodies (p. 309 above).            In fact we learn little from these snippets save
that Diogenes had read Anaxagoras’s book, in which he would find the
impressive story of the Aegospotami meteorite. He is also coupled
with Anaxagoras as believing that the cosmos took a tilt after animals
had appeared on the earth (p. 305 above).                       He did indeed refine the
‘incandescent stornes” into pumice, whose obvious qualities are lightness
and porosity. The latter would allow internal fire to shine through, but
is also brought into connexion with a possibly interesting idea that the

world has brearhing-holes.            Diogenes may have put to a new use the
breathing-holes in Anaximander’s                star-wheels® and        also remembered
something of the Pythagorean notion that the cosmos breathes in from
the ‘void’ outside. Those who had said this identified ‘void’ with
breath (vol. 1, 280). For Diogenes too the world was surrounded with
infinite air or breath, though this was interspersed with true void to
allow of its expansion and contraction.? The ingenuity with which he
adapted the various conceptions of his predecessors to a system in keep~
ing with the most recent advances of thought compels an admiration
which is scarcely conveyed by the word ‘eclecticism’.
For Anaxagoras the whole sum of matter had once been motionless,
<p>and the action of Mind was needed to set it in motion. Since Diogenes
identified the ruling mind with matter itself, he naturally took the
opposite view. The present cosmos has had a beginning and will in due
time disappear again. On the question whether other worlds exist
simultaneously or there is only a temporal succession of one at a time,
the evidence is conflicting, nor can we be certain what Theophrastus
recorded. Aétius (2.1.3; DK, 12 417) and the Stromateis, already
quoted, credit Diogenes with innumerable worlds, but Simplicius,
expanding with examples a passage in which Aristotle contrasts those
who believed in innumerable worlds with those who believed in one
only, puts him among those who believed in one world at a time,
perishing and renewed periodically. Seeing thar he wrote after
Leucippus, and accepted from him the existence of void and the infinite
extent of matter, it seems more likely that he also took over the in-
numerable worlds, coexistent as well as successive.
 He followed Anaxagoras in supposing the earth to be supported on
<p>air, and in the theory of its porous consistency, full of inter-
communicating channels. For the origin of the sea he is said to have
gone back to Anaximander. It is what remains of a layer of water on
the earth, which the sun is gradually drying by evaporation. This
evaporation is also the cause of its saltness, for it is the sweet water that

draw in the life-giving breath from outside, it was presumably impenetrable elsewhere. Perhaps
Diogenes borrowed the idea of a ‘membrane’ from Lencippus, but there is no information.</p>

is evaporated out of it first.               On the Nile floods he seems to have
attempted originality, with a curious theory based on evaporation from
the earth. As reported by Seneca he said that this takes place especially
in the South.       Because of the subterranean perforations, one part cannot
be dried up while another overflows with water. The dry parts draw on
the moist, so there is a rush of water from north to south. Seneca finds
this explanation inadequate, and if he has reported it fully one can only
agree with him.<em>                                                                        \
 Same of his predecessors had made wind the agent of thunder, others
<p>fire. Diogenes hospitably suggested that there were two kinds:
thunder preceded by Yightning was caused by the fire, other thunder-
claps by wind. So at least Seneca reports, and this can be reconciled
with the version of Aétius that thunder is ‘an incursion of fire into a
moist cloud, which causes thunder by its quenching and lighing by
its hrilirnce; but he also adduces,wind as a part-cause.’
 Diogenes had an elaborate and rather fantastic theory of magnetic
<p>attraction. We may consider it briefly in relation to the other Pre-
socratic theories on this subject of which anything is known, namely
those of Empedocles and Democritus (pp. 232, 426). Our knowledge
of all three comes from a chapter on magnetism in the Namra/ Questions
of Alexander of Aphrodisias, and is mainly interesting for the ingenious
way in which all alike tried to apply the general principles of their
systems to this as to other physical phenomena.

<p>                      Meteorology and Magnetism
Diogenes, with his belief in air—warmer or colder, wetter or drier—
<p>as the basic form of marter, tended to explain a great deal on the
analogy of breathing. Even inanimate substances like metals inspired
or expired, not atmospheric air but a dampness or moisture, so that the
expulsion of it was a kind of sweating. We shall see in relation to his
psychology what a key position the two words moisture (ixués) and
drawing in (fAkew) had in his system. Both iron and the lodestone
are subject to this process, but because the lodestone is “more earthy
and of looser texture’ it draws in more moisture than it expels. Apply-
ing also the principle of like acting on like, he explains that it draws in
the sweat (as one might call it} of iron but not of other metals. Since
its more open texture enables it to suck it in “all at once’, this action is
powerful enough to drag the iron with the moisture that it exudes.
This is an adaptation of the Empedoclean theory of pores and
<p>effluences, which Empedocles had already applied to magnetism.
According to him, efluences from the magnet fit the pores of the iron
and by entering them drive out the air which they contain. This in-
creases the flow of effluences from the iron so powerfully that as
they press into the pores of the magnet the iron itself is drawn after
them. Alexander complains that on this theory there is no reason why
the iron should be drawn to the magnet rather than vice versa, and
Diogenes’s suggestion of the looser texture of the lodestone seems a
refinement designed to overcome this objection. The theory of Demo-
critus is essentially that of Diogenes with the necessary modification
that the effluences are streams of atoms.t</p>

                    (s) Life, thought and sensation
<p>In Greek thought the soul (psyche) which animates living creatures has
two main functions: it gives the body its power of movement and makes
it aware of its surroundings throngh sensation and (in the case of
human beings) thought.        Some laid more stress on one of these func-
tions, some on the other, Diogenes was classified by Aristotle as one of
those who tried to explain both. For him the psyche was air (fr. 4), and
it acts in this dual way by being at once the basic substance of which all

existing things are modifications, and in its typical form the lightest,
finest and hence most mobile form of body, corresponding to the tiny
smooth soul-atoms of Democritus.' As such it imparts motion to the
body, and as the common element it can cause awareness on the
widely accepted principle that like is known by like, crudely applied by
Empedocles in the line that ‘with carth we see easth, with warer water’.
This air which is soul, says Diogenes (ft. ), is warmer than the
<p>atmosphere but much colder than that in the neighbourhood of the
heavenly bodies. There its divinity is unalloyed, but eved “the air
within us has perception because it is a small part of the God’. This
sentence comes from Theophrastus’s De sensu, as does practically all
our information about Diogenes’s views on thought and sensation
except What is in the actual fragments.? Since God is mind, what per-
ceives is essentially intelligence. That is why when the mind is dis-
tracted we do not perceive though sights and sounds may be presented
to our eyes and ears.3 To be the agent of thought the air must be pure
and dry, for moisture impedes intelligence. Like Heraclitus, Diogenes
mentions drunkenness in this connexion. Sleep is also caused by a
moistening of the air-sonl. (More specifically it is said to occur when
bload fills the veins and drives the air in them to the chest and stomach,
A&amp;t 5.24.3, 420.) The derail of these materialistic explanations verges
on the fantastic, and it is not surprising that they appealed to Aristo-
phanes’s sense of the ridiculous.4 Animals are less intelligent than men
because they breathe air closer to the earth and eat moister food. Since
this argument cannot apply to birds, a physiological explanation is
found for their lack of reason: their breath is confined to the belly
where it is ali used up in the digestion of food. (Hence also the rapidity
of this process in birds.) He added more perceptively that the forma-

standing between the birds impossible. The intellectual immaturity of
children is due to the fact that they have more moisture in their bodies
than adults, which prevents the drier air from permeating the whole,
and forgetfulness has a similar cause.
Within his materialism Diogenes seems 10 have come nearer than
<p>any     other     fifth-century       philosopher        to the distinction            between       a
physical and a psychological event which was clearly drawn by Aristotle,
Democritus explained vision simply as the reflexion of the object in
the eye. Why then, asked Aristotle, has not every reflecting surface the
power of sight? In an act of sensation, alteration of the bodily organ
is only a precondition, not the sensation itself. One must distinguish
between organ and faculty, the latter being an aspect of the psyche. The
perception of warmth is something different from the material affection
of becoming warm.<em>              Some inkling of this meets us in Diogenes when
he notes that mental distraction can prevent perception of what is
physically present to the sense-organs. The mind is pure, dry air, and
in his theory of sight, for instance, Theophrastus reports him as saying
that while objects must be reflected in the pupil, they are only seen if
the pupil ‘is mingled with the internal air’ which is the mind. When
the vessels or ducts of the eye are inflamed, he adds, sighe is impaired
because the passage of air is interrupted, although the image appears
in the pupil just the same. Thus, as Theophrastus admits, he to some
extent refutes those who equate sight with reflexion, ‘though without
assigning the right cause himself” (De sensu, 47). That an Aristotelian
should allow so much to a materialistic theory is evidence of the
ingenuity with which it was applied.
 Diogenes followed Empedocles in holding that black eyes see better
<p>by day (and with bright objects), others by night, giving as his reason
that the contrary colour is better reflected. Keenness of sight depends
on purity of air and fineness of the ducts, as with the other senses, and
also on a lustre in the eye promoting reflexion.                          Hearing takes place
when air within the ear is stirred by that outside and transmits the
motion to the brain. Large, erect ears are desirable, and short, fine,
straight ducts. “Air around the brain’ is made responsible for the sense
of smell, because it is ‘massed”’ there, and in Theophrastus’s termino-

logy so blended as to be ‘commensurate’ with the odour. At the same
time keen scent is associated with a small amount of air in the head,
because it and the odour then ‘blend mast quickly’, as well as with the
length and narrowness of the passage through which it is drawn in,
giving the opportunity for its detection. This is alleged as the reason
why some animals have keener scent than man, though our scent is
also keen when odour and cephalic air are of a composition to mingle
easily.” The tongue is the organ of raste because of its sponginess
(sofmess and porosity) and the number of vessels which Jead into it.
From it the flavours can be dispersed through the body and reach the
central organ of sense.?
Diogenes appears to have followed Alcmaeon and Anaxagoras in
<p>regarding the brain as the central organ of sensation and thought,
rather than making it the heart like Empedocles and his Sicilian
followers. We have noted that hearing requires that the motions should
be transmitted from the ear to the brain, which also figured in smelling.
That the air should be ‘massed’ there (&amp;Bpovs) is a hint in the same
direction. A passage in the Hippocratic treatise on the Sacred Disease
begins: ‘I hold that the brain has most power in man’, and continues
in a way that shows clear dependence on Diogenes: ‘For the brain, if
it is healthy, is the interpreter of the things that come into being from
air; and air provides intelligence.” When a man draws breath it goes
first to the brain and then to the other parts of the body, leaving in the
brain its best part, that which is wise and understanding. Otherwise it
would absorb moisture from the flesh and blood and reach the brain
* Some detals of Diogenes’s theories of hearing and smell are obscure owing to texmal
<p>difficulties. See the apparatus in DK, notes ad foc. in Steatton, and Beare, 105, t140f.
 * Combining Theophr, De sensu, 40 and 43 with Aet. 4,18,2 (DK, a12), If by #Bov in 43
<p>Theophrastus simply meant *pleasure’, I am sure Beare (169, n. 3) is right in holding that this is
a misundetstanding and that the word in Diogenes meant ‘taste’, as in fr. § and Anaxagoras . 4.
Yet to call it a misunderstanding may be an aver-simphfication. To suggest that Theophr. himself
was thunking of mste may seem ta accuse him of clumsy arrangement, stnce the words apparently
come ina discussion of pleasure and pain. In fact however the undoubred use of 45ovk for
flavour is evidence that there was a peculiarly tntimate connexion in the Greek rmind between taste
and pleasure or its opposite. Thus Aristotle says (De an. 414b13) that hunger is a desire for the
dey and warm, thirst for the cold and wet; and flavour is a kind of A8uopc of these. In Hippacr.

dulled and impure.” Moreover Aristotle, after quoting at length the
detailed description of the course of the veins in Diogenes, Syennesis
and Polybus, says (HA4, 513a9): ‘There are other writers on nature
who have described the veins in less merticulous detail, but all alike
trace their origin from the head and the brain.” The starting-point of
the blood was also the seat of consciousness, both in Aristotle himself
and earlier writers; and particularly for Diogenes, who emphasized the
part played by the veins in carrying air as well as blood. ‘Perceptions
take place when the air with the blood pervades the whole body through
the veins.” (Simpl. Phys. 153.13; see fr. 6.)*
Diogenes agreed with the atomists in holding that sensations were
<p>subjective and relative.3 He is classed with them by Aétius (4.9.8,
423), and fr. 5 shows that perceptions will differ according to the
constitution, and in particular the temperature, of the air in each
individual. Pleasure, pain and emotions have similar physical causes.
Pleasure attends on a rich mixrure of air lightening the blood, pain on
a pathological condition in which the blood is sluggish and thick
through lack of air uniting with it (Theophrastus, De sensu, 43).
Should the air leave the blood altogether, death occurs (Aét. 5. 24. 3,
A 29).</p>

* The statemment at Aét. 4.5.7 that for Diogenes the fiysioviéy is in the heart must be a
<p>mistake. There is a similar mistake about Democritus: at 4. 4.6 it is said that the reasoning part of
the soul is in the breast, at 4.§.1 that the fiyswovikév is in the brain. Aristotle in the passage
quoted clearly includes Diogenes among those wha traced the origin of the veins ta the head.
It must be admirted, however, as Littré noted (1, 220), that this does not emerge at all cleatly
from the description of the system in Diogenes which he actually quotes. Burnet (EGP, 348)
wrote that ‘no special seat, such as the heart or die brain, was assigned 1o the soul; it was simply
the warm air circulating with the blood in the veins’. Similarly, Wellmann (FG4, 1, 15, n. 4)
says that Diogenes <em>der Seele kein bestimmtes Organ als Sitz anweist”. This of course is true for
i     as a2 whole, as with the atomists. But that would nat prevent Diogenes from supposing,
ike them, that there was a concentration of it in a particular part of the body which served as a
central organ of cognition or common sensorium. Weygoldt (Lrch. f, Gesch. d. Phil. 13888,
165 £.) claims that De morb. sacr. 3 (V1, 366 L.) reproduces Diogenes’s account of the veins mare
aceurately than Aristotle; and this does say that ¢AiPes bs aimdv [sc. Tév Eyxépadov] telvouomw £

not involve the blatant contradicrion which Natorp saw in st (RA. Mus. 1887, 383). Actual sensa-
tions are still due to the interaction between the object of sense and the human body, the constitu-
tion of which varies from one individual to another.</p>

<p>Since Diogenes’s explanations of sensation and thought were entirely
physiclogical, something has already been said on this subject; for the
rest, he had a physician’s interest in the body, and there are one or two
references to the diagnosis of disease, mentioning colour and the state
of the tongue as particularly useful indications. Colour, says Galen,
was reckoned by ¢ Diogenes and the pundits of his time” to be the most
accurate sign. They classified diseases by it, matching di@erent com-
plexions with amount of blood and prevalence of the different humours.
 Some reports of his views on reproduction and embryology have been
<p>preserved. They say that he accepted the etymology of aphrodisia from
aphros,‘ foam’, holding that semen was a foam or froth formed from the
blood by the heat of the male in copulation. Being the vehicle of life, it
naturally contains a high proportion of air. Embryos are nourished not
through the umbilical cord but by fleshy cup-shaped growths (‘ cotyle-
dons”) on the sides of the womb.* Only the male parent contributes
seed, not the female, a contradiction of Empedocles (p. 217 above). The
formation of the male body takes four months, of the female five. Flesh
is formed first, out of moisture, then bones, sinews and the other parts
from flesh. Infants are bornlifeless, but ‘in heat’ (or ‘warm’): hence the
innate heat,as soon as thebabe isdelivered, draws the cold into thelungs.3</p>

porary Diocles rather than the fifth-century Diogenes (fr. 27 Wellmann; Jaeger, Diokles, 166).

  3 For sources of this paragraph see A26-8     (Censorinus and Aétius), The account of the in-
fant’s first breath may be compared with those of Empedocles and Fhilolaus (pp. 219f. abave and
vol. 1, 278£.). There 15 no suggestion in these that it is lifeless until this rakes place. Diller
(Hermes, 1941, 373) explains Diogenes thus: &amp;fp in Greek usage is cold and darp.         Hence the
warmth, which is to be characteristic of the viral air, exists within us before birth. Nevertheless
the embryo is lifeless. Only by breathing, which is contemporaneous with bizch, is the life-giving
coolness of the outer air drawn into s by the warmth.        In breathing not only is the internal
warmth cooled, but the air that enters is warmed, and only by this mingling does it become
specifically soul. The warmer air is higher and more divine (Diller sees Heraclitean influence
here), whereas Diogenes’s physiological interests made him realize that the air we breathe is cold.
(One may compare ft. 5: the soul is air warmer than that outside us. So far 25 it goes this accords
with Diller’s explanation.)
  The order of formation of the various bodily tissues is described similatly and in greater detail
in the Hippocratic De nat. pueri, 16f. (vi1, 496{. L.), no doubt following Diogenes.     See Wey-

To explain breathing Diogenes made use of the newly vindicated con-
<p>cept of void. Like Anaxagoras he maintained that fish breathed, but,
says Aristotle, whereas Anaxagoras had had to explain this on the
assumption that there was no void, Diogenes said that when they expel
water through their gills they suck air out of the water round the mouth
by means of the vacuum formed in it (De resp. 470b30—471a5).                            Plants
cannot breathe because they have no hollow parts in which a void can
be created.”
If we agree with those who have claimed to recognize Diogenes as
<p>the source of certain passages in Xenophon, we find him working out
his teleological interpretation of nature in a systematic series of
parallels between parts and organs of the bady and human technical
devices. The eyelids are doors, the eyelashes sieves, the eyebrows like
the cornices of a building to keep away sweat, the excretory system
corresponds to drains, conveniently placed where the effluent will least
offend the senses.?
                                   (7) Conclusion
<p>There is no mention of Diogenes by name in any writer before Aristotle,
yet his theories seem to have made a great impression on his con-
temporaries and immediate successors, in so far as we may assume that
he was the originator of them. The idea of air as both God and the mind
of man appears in the prayer of Hecuba in Euripides’s Zroades (884£.):
O thou on whom earth ndes and who hast thy station above the earth,
whosoever thou art, hard to divine or know, Zeus,3 be thou nature’s com-
pulsion or mind of man, to thee I pray; for treading thy noiseless way thou
Teadest aright all the things of mortals.
In the Clouds of Aristophanes (264), Socrates prays to the ‘ Lord and
Master, measureless Air, who holdest the earth aloft’, and swears by
  <em> Theophr. De sensu, 44.    One other observation about plants is recorded for Diogenes, also
10 contrast to Anaxagoras. Whereas the latter spoke of seeds faliing from the air and generating
plants, Diogenes attributed their origin to water “rotting® and mixing with earth, (Theophr,
HP, 3.1.4. The subject of yswiv would seem to be grammatically onépucrea, not &amp;ip as
DK say at 432.)

deduced from the poer's pronouncement       that Zeus knew    everything (Philodemus,    De pier.

Respiration, Chaos and Air instead of by the Olympians (v, 627). He
philosophizes from a basket suspended aloft, in order to ‘mingle his
fine (Aemrtrv) wit with the kindred air’, and explains that if he were
down on the earth it would draw to itself the moisture of his mind
(226#.).    More seriously, in Plato’s Phaedo (96b), among the theories
which Socrates studied as a young man was the one which said that we
think by means of air (as well as those of Empedocles and Heraclitus
that blood and fire respectively are the vehicles of thoudht) An
obvious parody of the same ideas occurs in a rather later comic poet,
Philemon (born ¢. 361 B.C.; fi. 91, DK, 64c4):            '
I am he from whom none can hide in one single thing that he may do, or be
about 1o do, or have done in the past, be he god or man. Air am I, whom
one might also call Zeus. I am everywhere, as a god should be——here in
Athens, in Patrae, in Sicily, in all cities and in all homes, in every one of you.
There is no place where is not Air. And he who is present everywhere,
because he is everywhere of necessity knows everything.
There is no need to argue the identity of Philemon’s air-god with
<p>that of Diogenes fir. § and 7. At the same time it must be remembered
that many of Diogenes’s ideas were part of the intellectual elimate of
the fifth century, and did not originate with him. The supporting of
the earth by air, mentioned by both Euripides and Aristophanes, goes
back to Anaximenes and was retained by Anaxagoras and Democritus
and the author of the Hippocratic De flatibus (p. 310 above). Probably
the last-named was indebted to Diogenes, for there is other evidence
in the Hippocratic writings of his influence on medical science. The
connexion between the moisture in the earth and that in aliving creature
occurs in the treatise On the Nature of the Child (p. 209 above), and
might have been borrowed by Aristophanes from Hippocrates or one
of his school as easily as from Diogenes himself, and the philosophic
author of The Sacred Disease owed him a pretty obvious debt.”
Serious attempts have been made, by diligent comparison of passages,
<p>to estimate the influence of Diogenes in particular matters. The details
must remain in part debatable,? for it is difficult to be certain about the

originator of some theories which were obviously common ground
among a number of investigators at the same time. It may be said,
however, that he both developed and popularized three doctrines, all
interrelated : the idea of air as arché, the essential identity of microcosm
and macrocosm (the human soul and the divine, omnipresent, control-
ling mind), and the teleological interpretation of nature. The import-
ance of this outlook on the world for medical theory, for Plato,
Atistotle and Hellenistic thought fully justifies his position in the main
stream of Greek philosophy, and his restoration of a physical monism
in the face of Eleatic argument and the pluralistic tendencies of his
time was a zour de force which must not be underestimated.<em>
Two additional points may be singled out as being of some philo-
<p>sophical interest. First, Diogenes was led to distinguish between sense-
organ and perceiving mind by the observation that it is possible not
to perceive although suitable objects are presented to the senses.</p>
</em>
Secondly, there is his suggestion that a subjective or relativist theory
of perception was not incompatible with the assumption of a common
object of sense endowed with all sensible qualities.3

which do not characterize the object. A. O. Lovejoy had maintained that this was so, but in the
author’s view (C. A, Baylis), if, say, a theatre-curtain has a succession of different-coloured lights
played on it, and some of those laoking at it suffer from red-green or blue-yeflow colour-
blindness, the fact tha: some people see different colours successively on the surface of the same
curtain, and some simultaneousty see different colours from others, should not be explained by
saying chat the curtaa cannot be characterized by these incompatible colours, * Why not say that
its surface has all the corresponding colour qualities, though for these to be seen requires special
combunations of a lgght ray of a certain sort with a perceiver of a cerrain sort?’ The two points of
view here represented bear some relation to those of Democritus and Diogenes respectively.

                 THE        ATOMISTS OF THE
                           FIFTH CENTURY
<p>The atomic theory was the work of Leucippus and his pupil Democritus,
and it is with this pre-Platonic atomism that we are here éoncerned.
it was continued and modified, from different motives, by Epicurus
at the end of the fourth century,<em> but this belongs to a later chapter
of our history. Diogenes Laertius gives a fairly full account &amp;f general
principles, cosmogony and cosmology according to Leucippus, but in
other sources the atomic theories are most commonly attributed either to
both men together or to Democritus. Evidently Democritus, who was
a most prolific writer, followed his master in essentials, but developed
and elaborated his theories considerably from (it would seem) a more
empirical and Jess deductive viewpoint. He also displayed an interest in
ethical questions which there is no evidence that Leucippus shared. It
will be best to treat the atomic world-view of this period asa single whole
(except for a few points of detail on which a difference is recorded),
after first saying something about the two men who were its authors.?

</em> Alferi (Estudios Mondolfo, fasc. 1, 149 f1.; Atomos Idea, ch. 2) suggests that the name <em>School
of Abdera’ would be better than “Atomists’ if one wishes to exclude Epicureanism, as avoiding
the necessity of speaking of ‘older atomism’, It is justified, he claims, if (as with the Eleatics) one
means by ‘school’ not a thiasos like the Pythagorean or a community in a gymnasion like the
Academy or Lyceum, but a succession of philosophers of whom one was the disciple of the other.
Leucippus must have written his works, and taught Democrirus, at Abdera. Democritus,
Anaxarchus and Bion were Abderites. Hecataeus and Nausiphanes came from Teos, the mother-
city of Abdera which maintained close relations with it. Metrodorus of Chios must have come
to Abdera to be Democritus's pupil. From Abdera issued all those works of Democtitus which
canstituted an encyclopaedia of knowledge unparalleled until Aristotle. The readers and dis-
seminators of these books constitute the Schoo! of Abdera; they are disciples of Democritus
whether or not he gave them oral mstruction. It is possible to name eleven who were more or
less certainly members of this school, which covered a cenrury and a half, roughly from Cimon
and the building of the long walls of Athens to Prolemy Lagus, in whose reign lived Nausiphancs.
Here, however, we shall not be concerned with Nausiphanes nor with any other of the epigoni
<p>of Democritus, some of whom there is no evidence to connect with the atomic theory of reality.
Nor has Protagoras a place in a discussion of atomism, though his omission would be unpardon-
able in any chapter claiming to deal with the philosophers of Abdera.

</p>
</em> Bailey (G. dromists, 68) claims that this is an unsatisfactory procedure. Yet much that he
assigns to the section on Leucippus alone is attributed in the sources to Leucippus and Democeitus</p>

<p>Epicurus, who adopted the atomic system a century after Democritus,
is reported as having said that there never was such a philosopher as
Leucippus.® This statement gained surprising credence among some
scholars, but the matter has now been thoroughly thrashed out and need
not detain us long.<em> It is quite incredible in face of the repeated mentions
of him, both alone and with Democritus, by Aristotle and Theo-
phrastus (or those who quote him). Epicurus was notoriously touchy
on the subject of predecessors. He claimed (manifestly falsely) complete
originality, and heaped contemipt and ridicule on those from whom he
might be supposed 1o have learned.3 In Hellenistic times the greater
fame of Democritus certainly relegated Leucippus to the background.
This would be not only because Democritus was a greater philosopher
with more universal interests, but also because he wrote a large number of
published works which were carefully edited and highly praised for their
purely literary merits. In this respect ancient critics, including Cicero,
coupled his name with Plato’s. What Leucippus wrote, on the other
hand, was probably more in the nature of school literature, disseminated
by being read aloud as lectures, and, as Stenzel says, where recognition
by posterity is in question, the contest between works like these and
brilliant literary productions on the same subject is an unequal one.4
together. No doubt Leucippus as the older man deserves the credit due to a pioneer, but in default
of more rigid separation in the sources we cannot say how far he went, and nothing is lost by
taking the system of the two men as a whole. A more detailed attempt to separate them was made
by Dyroff, Demokritstudien, 3--49, but though this work offers much of interest, it is not free
from dublous argument and questionable statements and must be used with caution. See also

  * RE,   xu1, 2270.   Stenzel notes that the same thing happened within the corpus of Plato’s
writings. The case of Aristotle, which Stenzel does not mention, might be thought to be a
contrary instance, but it must be granted that the early history of his writings is unique, and by all
accounts owed much to sheer accident.</p>

Even so, Cicero cites Leucippus twice, noting in one place (N.D.
1.24.66) that he came hefore Democritus.
Some said that Leucippus was from Miletus, others from Elea, others
<p>from Abdera. The three places epitomize his chief philosophical
associations:      essentially     Ionian in outlook, he was well versed in
Eleatic philosophy, and he taught Democritus the Abderite.                               It is
therefore easy for the sceptic to say that the traditional localizations
have no basis in fact, but are simply projections from the philosophy.
The less sceptical prefer to account for the philosophical history by
sojourns in each place. So Kranz held (Hermes, 5912, 19) that he was
certainly born at Miletus, went to Elea and studied under Zeno, then
turned back eastward and founded his school at Abdera.                            Since the
statements are there, but there is no means of checking them, the choice
in this not very important matter is free.<em>
Of his date one can say that he was older than Democritus, who
<p>was born about 460, old enough too to have influenced Diogenes of
Apollonia whose teaching was satirized by Aristophanesin 423 (pp. 362,
above), but young enough to be acquainted with the doctrines of
Zeno and Melissus as well as Parmenides. He is said to have been
Zeno’s pupil, and there is no reason why this should not be true.
Theophrastus’s testimony is likely to be the most accurate, but is not
unequivacal: ¢ Leucippus of Elea or Miletus (both accounts of him are
current) was associated with Parmenides in philosophy, but did not
go the same way as Parmenides and Xenophanes in his explanation
of reglity, indeed it would seern he went the opposite way.” The siate-
ment that he was ‘associated with Parmenides’ is ambiguous in the
Greek, but if we agree that it implies personal association it could
still be true, and need not conflict with calling him a pupil of Zeno,
since if Parmenides was alive when Leucippus went to Elea he must
have been an old man and Zeno already mature. 1t cannot be far wrong

then did the two men associate?) To Gomperz (Gr. Th.1, 567) it appeared most likely that he was
a Milesian “hecause in the two other cases of Elea and Abdera his relations with Zeno and Demo-
critus respectively might be regarded as probable sources of error’,</p>

to date the promulgation of his theory round about the year 430 or
a little eatlier.t
 Ofhis works there is mention of a Grear World-System and a treatise
<p>On Mind. In Hellenistic times the former was attributed to Demo-
critus, as well as a Lirtle World-System, but Diogenes Laertius in the
fist of Democritus’s works notes against the Great World-System that
Theophrastus and his school assign it to Leucippus. Theophrastus was
in a better position to know than Thrasyllus, whose catalogue, of the
first century A.p., Diogenes is reproducing. By that time there existed
a kind of corpus of the literature of atomism under the name of Demo-
critus, its mast famous representative. The existence of two works with
the same title, distinguished as ‘Great’ and ‘Little’, makes the differ-
ence of authorship all the more likely. The epithets probably do not
refer to size.       Democritus may have called his cosmology ‘the Little’
out of modesty, and Leucippus’s could have been dubbed “the Great” in
consequence.? Others have assumed a difference of content, the work
of Leucippus being cosmological (covering the ground later traversed
by Lucretius in books 1 and 2) whereas Democritus supplemented this
with an account of the origin and development of human life and
civilization (corresponding to Lucretius §). This suggestion3 is sup-

implied a personal relationship absent from the x. Tis <em>Avafutvous pikovoglas which Theas
phrastus said of Anaxagoras. For Leucippus as pupil of Zena see D.L. 9.30, Clem. Strom. 11,

  Xf we wish 1o speculate, there is something attractive about the suggestion of Alfieri (Eseud,
Mondolfo, 165), based on the three places with which his name 1s connected, that he left Miletus at
the revolution of 450, moved to Elea, then came to Abdera abaut 440 and taught his new dactnine
to Democritus who would be about 20. In this way the atomic theory in general would be the
resultof collabaration between the older and younger man rather than of successive developments,

</em> See DK, 15, 8om.; ZN, 1040 n.; Bailey, Gk. Aromists, 113. Ch. Mugler (Rev. de Philol. 1055,
13) assumes without argument a distinction of substance different from that mentioned in the
text. The Mixpds Bidwoopos (by Democritus) was the study of 2 single world (our own for ex-
ample), whereas the Méyes 8. (by Leucippus) described the process of selection whereby cerrain
of the infinitely various atoms in the infinite void came together and were formed into a world.
It js difficult to see any particular justification for this, but even if Democritus’s main subject was
the microcosm he would preface it with a summary of the cosmogony evolved by Leucippus and
himself.   For Tonians anthropology was only a continuation of the same cosmic study.

 thinks that to suppose a difference of theme goes against linguistic usage. In view of the con-
 fidence with which some modern scholarship has assumed that Mucas Siéxoonos and the develop-
 ment of civilization are synonymous (see especiaily Schmide, op, cir. 1.5.2-2, 264), it must be
 emphasized that this is conjectural even if hkely.

colony established from Teos in this remote north-eastern region about
the middle of the sixth century, after an earlier unsuccessful attempt by
Clazomenae. In his curiosity and zest for travel he resembled a more

</em> Thrasyllus’s catalogue of the works of Demacritus also includes a TTept vot, and those who
did not helieve in the existence of Leucippus naturally thoughe that this was the wark which
Theophrasnis had atmbuted to him.        Tr may have been general rather than psychologica! in
content, containing a refutation of the voUs of Anaxagoras as 2 cosmological principle; but this
can only be a guess. See Stenzel, RE, xu, 2273{,; Alfiexi, Aromisti, 9 f.; Kerschensteiner, Kosmos,

Yoo .41 and 34. The phrase &amp;riow otmob vedmmepos vertapéuovra occurs in both places,
<p>and some have thought it a suspiciously Apollodoran number.       Apollodorus, who liked to space
out the generations of philosophers at forty-year intervals (cf. p. 2 above), 1s mentioned in the
next sentence of ch. 41 as datsng Democritus’s birth in Ol 80 {460~57). The number may however
be a coincidence, and the quotation from Democritus himself continues further as if the phrase
were a part of it. Thrasyllus (D.L. iid.) gave the third year of Ol. 77 (470-69), adding that he was
alder than Socrates, though the date makes him exacly the same age. Passages in Aristotle (Part.
an. 6422243 Meraph. 1078b174L.) have also heen thought, unjustifiably, to imply the temporal
priority of Democritus to Socrates. Later stortes that Protagoras was hus pupil cannot be recon-
ciled either with his own statement that he was much younger than Anaxagoras or with the dating
of Apollodorus or Thrasyllus, nor is were much temptation to believe them. They go with
anecdotal macter, their source is Epicurus (ap. D.L. 9.53 and Athen. 8.354c, DK, a0), and they
conflict with the better-attested fact thar Democrius n his own writings attacked Protagoras’s
teaching (p. 350 above).   See also ZN, 1302, nn. 2 and 4. The only sure testmony         is thac of
Demacritus himself.
For an introduction to modern controversy on the subject see ZN, 10446 n.; Alfien in Essud,

Davison, CQ, 1053, 38f. The arguments of Diels against Rohde, Rb. Mus. 1887, 15, are still
worth reading. Davison notes that since the Epicureans put his hirth about forty years too early,
they were probably responsible for the reports that he Jived 1o over a hundred, if he was known
to have died between 400 and 390. These reports come from Antisthenes of Rhodes and Hip-
parchus (ap. D.L. 9.9, 43) and ps.-Lucian, Macrobioi, 18 (DK, o6).

He was the subject of a number of anecdotes, none of which can claim

he bore in antiquity. Some he shares with other famous philosophers,
Thales, Anaxagoras or Protagoras. However, the general impression is
one of serenity, good humour and fortitude which accords well enough
with his surviving ethical precepts.3 His sobriquet of the Laughing
Philosopher, moved to mirth by the follies of mankind as Heraclitus

 His only undoubted teacher was Leucippus. Some said he was also

he ‘heard’ one of the Pythagoreans, whom                          Apollodorus of Cyzicuss
later identified with Philolaus. A book on Pythagoras was included
among his works, and was said to be laudatory. These contacts are
chronolegically possible, and the man who travelled as far as Egypt
and Persia to meet the world’s most famous teachers is not likely to
have neglected the opportunities that lay nearer at hand.

                                 (1) Fundamencals
<p>Atomism is the final, and most successful, attempt to rescue the realiy
of the physical world from the fatal effects of Eleatic logic by means of
a pluralistic theory. To its proponents, the infinite divisibihy and
qualitative differences of Anaxagoras’s ‘seeds’ seemed an evasion of the
question, and they found the solution rather in a reformed and corrected
version of Pythagoreanism. Aristotle, in one of his less fair-minded
moods (De caelo, 303a8), says that in a way they too claim that every-
thing that exists is numbers or evolved from numbers: ‘they may not
show it clearly, but this is what they mean’.<em> He is right to direct our
thoughts back to the Pythagoreans, but with the clarity owed to
Parmenides (p. 49 abave), the atomists perceived that these had over-
looked the unbridgeable gap berween mathematical figures and the
warld of nature. If this world was constructed out of units, they must
be units of solid physical substance.
Aristotle, after praising Leucippus and Democritus for their con-
<p>sistency and for beginning at the natural starting-point, explains how
their theory originated in a reaction from those who held that ‘what is”
  ' A warning is particularly necessary concerning the lengthy passages of Diodorus printed by
DK (1, 135 #.) with extracts from Tzetzes and Johannes Catrares as reproducing the content of
the Mikgds Bidxaopes of Democris.       Therr nclusion      depends on a confiden:    atribunon by
Resnhardr in 1912, which however was already seriously impugned by Dahlmann in 1928, since
when an extensive literature has accumulated around the subject. Although scholars differ ia their
positive conclusions, almost all ageee thac Reinharde’s thess is condemned by the absence of any
trace of the atomic world-view.   See p. 210, n. 1 above.    Alfieri   however (diom. Id. 130, 0. 3)
defends Reinhardt's view.

<p>                      The Atomises of the Fifth Century
must be one and immovable: void ‘is not’, and without a void separate
from it reality cannot move, nor can things be more than one if there
is nothing 1o keep them apart. He continues (GC, 325223):
But Leucippus thought he had a theory which would agree with the senses
and would not abolish coming-to-be or destruction or motion or the plurality
of existing things. So much he canceded to the phenomena, whereas to the
proponents of unity he granted that there could not be movement without
void, thar the void was ‘not heing’, and nothing of what is is not 1l7eing; for
what, stricily speaking, is, is completely full. Butsuch being, he claimed, is not
a unity. It consists of a plurality of things infinite in number and t0o small
to be seen. They move in the void (for there is void), and their combination
causes coming-to-be, their separation dissolution. They act and are acted
upon as they happen to touch (for in this way they are not one) and'generate
by coming together and interlocking.                A true unity can never give rise to
multiplicity, nor a true plurality produce unity. That is impassible, but as
Empedocles and others say that things are acted upon by means of pores,
50 he claimed that alteration and every form of being-acted-on takes place
in this way: dissolution and destruction occur by means of the void, as also
does growth when solid hodies slip in [sc. to fill empty spaces].
Leucippus is here represented as insisting on the strice fulfilment of
<p>the Eleatic conditions of being. What is must be a plenum (cf. Parm.
8.22—). Generation and destruction in a literal sense are impossible.
What is one cannot become many, nor many things one. Hence the
insistence that what is built up out of atoms in contact is not a unity; no
new single being is generated by this means.?                           Only one thing is
¢ *As they happen to touch, for in this way they are natone,” # and ravm at 325 2 33 have
<p>been wranslared locally (‘where. . for there they are not one’) by Joachim and Forster, which
sounds as if a plurality of atoms were “one” when nor in contact, The point is, I think, that a
number of bodies cannot properly be said to have become a unity simply by contiguity or inter-
lacking with each other.   Leucippus and Democritas seem to have atrached great importance to
satisfying this particular Eleatic condition, and Aristatle mentions it several nmes: GC, 325b31,
according to Leucippus generation 15 {rom the atoms “by means of the void and through contact,
for by this each thing 15 divisible” (1 e. each composite body 15 divisible—1s not a anity—because
itis only an aggregate of uny unus 1n contact); On Demacritus, ap. Simpl. Cael. 195,11, ‘As they
move they callide and become entangled in sucha way that while they touch and lie close t0 one
anather, na single nature 15 ever truly generated from them, for he [Democnitus) held that it was
simply foolish to suppose that two or more could ever become one. The fact that they hold to-
gether for 2 cerrain time he attributed to their interlocking and catching hold of each other” (by
reason, as Anistotle goes on to explain, of their irregular shapes) ; also D« caela, 30336, Metaph.

is inconceivable. The way in which Leucippus met this difficulty, the
assertion that ‘void is not being yet exists’, is less paradoxical than it
sounds, when we remember the universal assumption hitherto that
whatever exists exists in bodily form.? Hence the Pythagoreans,
believing that geometrical figures exist, saw no difficulty in constructing
a physical world from them. Parmenides detected the flaw in this, but
himself described his non-sensible reality as a sphere and *full’, lan-
guage which led Burnet to regard it as corporeal, though we have seen
reason to doubt his judgment (p. 25 above). Leucippus seized on this
aspect of it. He clarified and made explicit the assumption that what
has real existence must be corporeal. But to say this does not imply that
it is continuously present everywhere. There can be places3 which it
does not occupy, though obviously it would be wrong to call these
spaces themselves ‘being’ or ‘an existing thing’. Anyone today who
looked in a box and reported ‘there’s nothing in it’, would similarly
claim to be misrepresented if told that he was denying the existence of
emptiness.          Here then, Leucippus thought, was a misundersianding
which alone had prevented philosophers from constructing a physical
world on Eleatic principles of being. Empedocles and Anaxagoras had
not done this, They had transgressed by admiting motion without
void, by attributing sensible qualities ta ‘what is” (Parm. 8.38-41) and
in Anaxagoras’s case by making ‘what is’ divisible (Parm. 8.22).
The admission of void brought with it the possibility of plurality
<p>and motion. Nothing else was needed for the construction of a cosmos</p>

<p>  <em> 1 believe that Parmemides hamself was responsible for the denmal of void (pp. 331. above).    If
however one prefers to substinie Melissus here, or speak of the Eleatics generally, the present
account is not affected.

</em> Zeno's pronouncements that ‘if what is had no magmude, it would not even be’ (frr. 1 and
z) have more than mathemarical significance. They show how inextricably existence was tied up
with corporeality at that ume. (oGpa and péyedos are synonymous in the argument of Dema-

out of elementary realities each of which satisfied the Eleatic conditions
of existence: for Being (6v) is substituted Beings (dvve).                         From these
intellectual origins sprang the first European theory of the atomic
structure of matter.
                          (2) General nature of atoms
<p>It is sometimes said® that Leucippus took up the challenge of Melissus:
that if, per impossibile, there were many things, each would have to
have the character of the Eleatic One as he saw it. Leuc1ppu§ said, in
effect, “Why not?’, and gave each of his atoms the same properties.
This needs quahﬁcatton.             Melissus said that the One was infinite, un-
moved, and without density. An atom is none of these. Lepcippus
looked rather to Parmenides, whose theory he modified only in the
minimal ways just mentioned. What exists must still be ungenerated
and imperishable, unchangeable, incapable of being added to or sub-
tracted from, homogeneous, finite and a plenum, continuous and in-
divisible. “ What is” may have void outside it, but none (and hence no
movement)        within.      All these conditions can be satisfied, thought
Leucippus, and the sensible world accounted for, on the supposition
that there are millions of such solid, imperishable entities of micro-
scopic size, surging around in infinite space.
A second account of the principles of atomism occurs in Aristotle’s
<p>historical review at the beginning of the Mezaphysics (985b4).                               Here
he says:
Leucippus and his associate Democritus name plenum and void as elements,
calling them ‘being” and ‘not-being’: the full and solid is being, the empty
and rare® is not-being.         Hence they say that being exists no more than not
being,? because void exists no less than body. These are the material causes

<p>This has already been mentioned on pp. 117f. above.
* Presumably Aristotle thought that the addition of the word pavée would make clearer what
<p> was meant by kevév.   In fact 1t is rather confusing, since elsewhere it does not mean completely
empty but only rare or loose in texture as opposed to tightly packed. Bailey (Aromists, 77) catls
it <em>one of those quaint terms which he [Leucippus] invented for the atomic theory, “porous™’;
 but in the first place he did not invent it (1t was probably used by Anaximenes, and oceurs in a
 line of Empedocles, fr. 75.1), and secondly Aristotle does not seem to be giving Leucippuss
 terms in this sentence;; otherwise he might be expected to have said vawTéw for oTepeov.

of things, and just as those who posit a single underlying substance generate
everything else by its affections, so they t0o say that the differences [sc. in
the atoms] are responsible for everything else.! These according to them are
three: shape, arrangement and position, for they say that they differ in
‘rhythm’,<em> touching”, and ‘ turning”. </em> Rhythm' is shape,‘ touching " is arrange-~
ment, and ‘turning’, position. For instance, A differs from N in shape, AN
from NA in arrangement, Z from N in position.®
With      differences      of shape        went        differences   of size,     not    men-
<p>tioned here but added by Aristotle elsewhere: (Phys. 203a33) ‘But
Democritus [sc. in contrast to Anaxagoras| claims that no elementary
particle arises from any other. Nevertheless their common body is the
source of everything, differing from part to part in size and shape.s
These are the only inwrinsic differences between atoms. ‘They are
differentiated by their shapes, but their substance (gUo1s) is one, just
as if each were a separate it of gold’ (De caelo, 275b31). They differ,
however, from a familiar substance like gold in being qualitiless, or at
least without sensidle qualities.# In this the atomists contradict Anaxa-

find it convincing, but others may.
* The mentton of material cause and underlying substance, like the description of plenum and
<p>void as oroixsia, can be ignored as restatements in. terms of Aristotle’s own theories.
* Aristotle’s example is I (the older form of zeta) and H. The aromists developed a technical

order and arrangement of the atoms, their aim seems ta have been (as I have tried to bring out in

of atoms were repeated by Boyle (Van Melsen, From Aromor 1o Azom, 100).

colour, taste and smell—must itself be without any of the various

Not only is the number of the atoms infinite, but they represent an
<p>infinite variety of form. They are ‘infinite both in number and in
shapes’. (So GC, 314a22, also 325b27. The reason which, Aristotle
gives for this, that ‘they saw reality in appearance, and the phenomena
are mutually contrary and infinite’ is probably his own inference. See
GC, 315b9; De caelo, 303a10.) Connected with this is a certdin doubt
of what Democritus said about their size. For Leucippus there is ne
problem. Nothing contradicts the statement that they were ‘invisible
owing to their small size’ (GC, 325a130). Aristotle says the same for
Democritus (ap. Simpl., DK, A 37): the atoms are ‘so small as to escape
oursenses’, and out of them he ‘ generates and constructs the visible and
sensible masses’. Similarly when Aristotle quotes the comparison of the
atoms (or a particular class of them, De en. 404a3) to motes dancing in a
sunbeam, Simplicius (De an. 25. 33) is careful to point out thar it is only
an analogy : the visible motes are not the microscopic atoms themselves.
Later sources hint at something different. Dionysius, a third-
<p>century Bishop of Alexandria quoted by Eusebius (P.£. 14.23; DK,
684 43), distinguishes Epicurus from Democritus on the grounds that
his atoms were ‘very small and for that reason imperceptible’, whereas
Democritus ‘assumed also very large atoms’. Aétius (1.12.6, A47)
even credits him with saying that there could be an atom as large as the
cosmos. Such sources can hardly be used to discredit Aristotle. It is
possible that the early atomists allowed themselves to say that the atoms
varied infinitely in shape and in size,' without perceiving that, since
their size had a lower limit, this would demand that there be no upper
limit;<em> and Epicurus criticized them for this on the grounds that some
atoms would have to be large enough to be visible. He may even have

said that logically Democritus’s theory demanded an atom as big as the
cosmos, These criticisms could easily mislead the Christian writer, wha
is explicitly contrasting the two systems and no doubt had Epicurus to
read but not Democritus.?
 The importance of the shapes of atoms in accounting for the variety
<p>of perceptible nature was emphasized by actually calling them ‘shapes’
or ‘forms’ as well as atoms.               Democritus wrote a work On Forms.?
 As the name ‘shapes’ emphasizes their variety, so the name arom
<p>calls attention to an essential characteristic, indivisibilicy.3 This followed
from their faithfulness to the pattern of the One of Parmenides, its

same time some atoms wouwd be bound to come into our hen and be visible; but this is never
seen to be the case, nor is it possible ta imagine how an atom could become visible.” (Trans.
Baley.) This sounds as i Democritus posited atoms in an infinite variety of sizes, but that it
was Epicurus who pointed out that this would ievitably involve visible atoms, in which neither
he nor Democritus believed,
The best discussion of the question is Alfiert's in Eprcurea in mem. Bignone, 62 (also drormos
<p>Idrn, 621, 129). Mugler (R. de Phibol. x959, p1.&gt; accepss Dionysius and Aetus without question,
and regards them as having preserved a fundamenta) difference between Leucippus and Demo-
crarus which had escaped all commentators beginning with Aristotle! Kerschensteiner (Kosmos,
 165, n. 3) is in doubt whether the idea of cosmos-sized atoms was the statement of a theorencal
possibility {so also ZN, z0660.) or originated in an Epicurean reductio ad absurdum of the Demo-
critean theoty. Freeman (Companion, 299f) regarded it as a misunderstanding, but her
discussion is vitlated by the suggestion that ‘iafinite in size” in D.L. means "infinitely small’,

For a different view see Mugler in REG, 1963, 397ff. From the staternent that a single atom is

Democritean atom were as big as the world it would sull be invisible. Tt rould not, after all,

homogeneity and fulness. ‘That which strictly i, is completely full’)
said Aristotle, and Philoponus adds a comment which suggests once
again that it was to ‘father’ Parmenides rather than to his followers
Zeno and Melissus that Leucippus looked for his arguments. Leucippus
proved the indivisibility of the atoms thus: each of the things that is, is
in the proper sense. In what is there is nothing that is not, hence no void.
Division cannot oceur without void, therefore it is impossible for them to
be divided (Philop. G, 158. 22). In any case ‘what is’ can suffer no
change (hencetheatomsareimpassible, &amp;mafeis) nor haveany patts (which
would destroy its absolute unity). Going beyond his Eleatic model,
Leucippus also alleged the smallness of hxs atoms as a reason for Ihelr
indivisibility, a more vulnerable argument than the purely logical one.
The question whether the atoms were not only physically but also
<p>theoretically or mathematically indivisible has naturally aroused great
interest among historians of mathematics. Burnet wrote (£GP, 336)
that ‘the atom is not mathematically indivisible, for it has magnitude;
it is however physically indivisible, because, like the One of Parmenides,
it contains no empty space’. This sentence correctly puts the emphasis
on the logical consequences of unity as seen by Parmenides: each atom
was to be a reproduction of the One. Recent work, however, tends to
confirm that Democritus held, and was prepared to argue, that his atoms,
being not only very small but the smallest possible particles of matter,
were not only too small to be divided physically but also logically
indivisible. To suppose otherwise would admit the principle of infinite
divisibility, which to Democritus was inconceivable.®</p>

<p>Any study of the cause and nature of motion in the atomic system must
start from the complaints of Aristotle that it was left unexplained.? The
historical summary quoted above on pp. 392f. continues immediately
(985b19): ‘But the question of movement, whence or how it helongs
to things, they too, like the others, carelessly neglected.” In De caelo

cussion reads very like special pleading.</p>

(300b8)       he says:      ‘Leucippus       and     Democritus,        who     say   that the
primary bodies are always in motion in the infinite void, ought to tell
us what sort of motion and what is their natural motjon.” Similarly
Metaph. 1071b31, where Leucippus is coupled with Plato as saying
that motion is everlasting, ‘but from what cause, or what kind it is,
they do not say, nor the reason why it is in this direction or in that’.
The inclusion of Plato in this condemnation may raise a doubt whether
the atomists in fact ‘ carelessly neglected” the question, or simply failed
1o provide an answer to satisfy Aristotle’s own particular requirements;
and other remarks of his own suggest that he may have found a little
more on the subject in their writings. Thus he says (G4, 742b17;
more briefly Phys. 252a32):
Those are wrong, and Fail to state the causal necessity, who say that things
have always happened so and think this explains their origin. So Democritus
of Abdera says that there is no beginning [or origin, arché) of the infinite,!
that a cause is an origin and what is everlasting is infinite; therefore 1o ask
‘why?” in a case like this is to look for an origin for the infinite.
 This tight little argument             has an Ionian sound,               and an Ionian
<p>reminiscence of the apeiron as arché.                It is certainly Democritus’s, and
many will agree with Sambursky that it was “a sound instinct” that led
the atomists to accept movement as a given fact rather than raise the
problem of the first cause.<em> It is more relevant to remember how much
of their stimulus came from the Eleatics. Eleatic standards must be up-
held to the greatest degree compatible with allowing for the obvious
fact of motion. The answer lay in the prime discovery that the notion
of empty space was not an illogical one. This immediately admitted
both plurality and movement.              Lookingback, it is not easy toappreciate
the complete novelry of the idea, though the fact that the atomists had
to clothe it in such paradoxical terms should help. L..lier thinkers had
never clearly conceived a vacuum: their primary substance or substances
had filled the whole. Only the Pythagoreans had spoken of void,and they
were so far from understanding its strict meaning that they had identified
it with air, which the universe could ‘breathe in’ (vol. 1, 280, 340).

<p>                       The Aromists of the Fifth Century
Parmenides had condemned for ever any system which, like the
<p>Milesian or the Pythagorean, combined the notions of a one and a
many. One could never become many, indeed all change and motion
were impossible because, among other reasons, void was an inadmissible
concept. Empedocles and Anaxagoras had tried to save the phenomena
by abandoning the original unity. Positing an initial plurality, they
thought to retain the possibility of locomotion by a kind of reciprocal
replacement.” Given such a plenum, an external cause of motion seemed
necessary if it was not to remain a static, frozen mass. Hence fthe Love
and Strife of Empedocles and the Mind of Anaxagoras. But to an age
for which only corporeal being was real, the introduction of Mind over
the mixture must have seemed suspiciously like the reintroduction, by
a back door, of the One behind the Many, laying Anaxagoras’s system
open once more to criticism of the Eleatic type.
These considerations may lead us to think that the atomists had
<p>consciously faced the problem of motion and its origin, and considered
that they were providing not only a necessary but a sufficient reason by
attributing it to the existence of void.                 Melissus, after all, had argued
directly from       the non-existence           of void      to that of motion           (fr. 7.7,
p- 104 above).         Earlier pluralist attempts to rescue phenomena from
Elearic Jogic had been baulked by the difficulties of accounting for a
beginning of motion in a mass of matter heterogeneous indeed, but
locked     together with         na chink       of empty        space between           its parts.
Substitute for this the alternative picture of an infinite number of
microscopic atoms let loose, as it were, in infinite empty space, and it is
as reasonable to ask ‘ Why should they stay still?<em> as </em> Why should they
move?’ Indeed Axistotle speaks in the Physics of those who ‘make the
void the cause of motion”.?              It does not in his eyes absolve them from
  <em> Probably if not cerninly.   See p. 147 with n. 1 above, as well as Solmsen, Arise.’s System, 142.
That both upheld the denial of void may be taken as cerrain. (Pp. 139, 275, n. z above.)

  the charge of neglecting the question, since from his point of view it
 was obvious that empty space was only a sine qua non, not a positive
  or sufficient cause such as his own (erroneous) mechanics required.
  But it may put us on the track. Coming at a stage in the history of
  thought when the need for a positive cause of motion was entangled
  with the lack of a true conception of void, the setting free of the atoms
  may well have seemed a sufficient explanation of their motion,combined
  with the assertion (a contradiction of Anaxagoras)                         that it had had
  no temporal beginning.              In rejecting the demand for a first active
  agent of motion, Leucippus and Democritus are nearer than Aristotle
  to the views current among European scientists since Galileo and
  Descartes.”
  There is another point of interest. Pre-Parmenidean Ionians had
<p>  also said that motion was eternal, but for them this conception was
  inevitably linked with that of life. What owed its motion to no cause
  outside itself was alive; if its motion was eternal, as that of the arché
  must be, it was not only alive but divine. The materialism of Leucippus
  and Democritus has restored the idea of motion as natural to matter
  and hence belonging to it from all time, but from this conception they
 _have removed the last traces of animism. The motion is purely lifeless
""and mechanical: It happened ‘automatically’ or ‘of necessity’ (con-
  cepts of which there will be more to say later). Is this perhaps one of
  their most original and influential contributions to thought? And was
  it not made possible by one thing only, the conscious postulation of an
  absolute void?

 Alfiesi (ap cit. 80) suggests another reason why the atomists were shy of offering 2 mare
<p>  positive explanation of motion, He claims that they could have had no reply to the Eleanc
  &amp;moplat abour it because, since they denied infinite divisibility, they were wide open to Zeno’s
  arguments against it. Body consisted of discontinuous atoms, and time must consist of dis-
  continuous instants. Yet they did not consider how the same body could occupy different parts
  of space in successive instants and so get from .4 10 B. Thus, he suggests, they had no mathe-
  matical or philosophical theory of movement, but a physical and empirical conception of it. On
  the atomists’ conception of time see also Luria, Infinitesimaltheorie, 1636 (who takes a more
  favourable view), and pp. 427f%. below.</p>

<p>                     The Atomists of the Fifth Century
      (4) Nawre of the original motion. the question of weight
<p>Accounts of the cosmogony of Leucippus start from the picrure of
countless atoms of varions shapes and sizes in motion in empty space.
They jostle, collide and become entangled, and here and there a com-
plex of them sets up the kind of vortex-like motion which was believed
necessary to create a world. The formation of the cosmos is then
explained as flowing from the action of the vortex and its effect on the
subsequent motion of the atoms. From the inception of % cosmic
system, therefore, their motion is accounted for, but this was not, as it
had heen for Anaxagoras, the beginning of motion altogether. Hence
from Aristotle down to the present day, the question has been put:
what caused the original motion, and what sort of motion was it?
Since Aristotle conld read Leucippus and Democritus and we no longer
can, we are not likely to get much further than he did: and on the cause
of motion he tells all that we need. Anaxagoras, they said, was wrong
to suppose that things were once at rest, and then began to move at a
particular point in time;" and if motion is eternal, it is idle to seek for
its cause. This argument would come particularly easily to a fifth-
century Greek, for whom the notions of beginning, origin, governing
 principle and cause were closely united in the single word arche’
“Alexander of Aphrodisias elaborates Aristotle’s criticism slighily
(Meraph. 36.21; DK, 67 4 6): ‘Leucippus and Democritus say the
atoms move by striking and knocking against one another, but whence
comes the beginning of motion for the natural world, that they do not
say.
 Of the cause of the original mation there is no more to be said. Of
<p>its nature, there have in the past been two contending views: one, that
it was a confused and aimless motion in all directions, the other, that it
  ¥ It is remarkable haw much mare stricdy than the earlier pluralists Leucippus obeyed the
dictates of Parmenides, while suceeeding in drawing opposite conclusions from them. What he
said of motion reminds one of Parmenides’s question about yévesis: Why should it have started
at one time rather than another?
* The case of the Latin principium was simulor, as when Cicero writes (Fin. 1 6.17): ‘eumque
<p>motum atomorum nullo a prinopw sed ex acterno sempore antellegi convemre’ Cf. Tusc.
1.23.54: ‘origo principii nulla est, nam ex principio oriuntur omnia.” For Aristotle too &amp;px4 and
almiov were inseparably united (e.g. Metaph. 1003b24), and it was only as a consequence of his
own teleological doctrine of potentiality and actuality that a world which was everlasting never-
theless needed an erer nally active &amp;py1 to sustain 1s operations.</p>

<p>                        Nature of the Original Motion
was 2 downward fall, or rain, of atoms due to weight. The evidence
must be considered here, but since the first view is not only pretty
certainly correct, but now generally accepted, we may be excused from
any detailed consideration of the rival views of the past.”
Against a downward fall as the original motion are all those passages
<p>in which Aristotle blames the atomists for neglecting to state eizher
what causes it or what kind of motion it is, and especially two of them.
At De caelo, 300b11 he follows up this criticism by saying that every
element must have a natural motion. This was his own belief, and it was
therefore in his eyes a basic fault that the atomists assigned no natural
motion to their own elements. But motion downwards was a natural
elemental motion for Aristotle, and if they had posited it he could not
have brought this charge. De caelo, 275b291. makes the point even
clearer: the atoms being all of the same substance ought to have a single
proper motion, and if, he continues, this were a motion due to weight,
the whole would have a centre and a circumference, which the space
of the atomists, being infinite, cannot have. The argument is hypo-
thetical. Neither here nor anywhere else does he criticize the atoms for
the absurdity of moving downwards in an apeiron.
More positively, in the extract from his work on Democritus (ap.
<p>Simpl. Cael. 295.9,68 437) he describes the original motion of the atoms
by the verb orooidzev—to quarrel, be at odds or in a state of discord
—-a metaphor from the al-too-familiar phenomenon of civil strife in
Greek states: ‘they are at odds and move in the void owing to their
dissimilarity and the aforementioned differentiae’. The image of a
mélée is made more concrete by the explanations of his commentators:
‘these atoms. . .are in motion in the void, and catching up with one
another they collide, whereupon some rebound at hazard and others
become entangled’ (Simpl. Cael. 242.21, 67 4 14). Alexander’s de-
scription is similar (see previous page). So also Aét 1.12.6 (68
* The chief upholder of uniform downward motion was Zeller (ZN, t084). The other view,
<p>which Brieger had put forward in 1884 (in bus Urewegung) and Liepmanr independently in 1886
(in his Mechanik), was vigorously reinstated by Brieger against Zeller in Philologus, xgo4. Both
these scholars however comphicated their position by trymg 1o mainzain that Leucippus and Demo-
critus did assign weight €0 the atoms as an onginal property whnle at the same time denysng that
it was the cause of their ongimal motion.   Of recent scholars taking a similar view 10 that taken
here it will suffice to mention Burnet (EGP, 3441, Bailey (Aromists, 83 Leucippus,             1298,

A 47)1 ‘Democritus says that the primary bodies, or solids, have no
weight but move according as they strike one another in the infinite,’
This is one of two passages in the Placita which expressly deny weight
to the atoms. The other is 1. 3. 18 (4 47), where a distinction is made on
this score between Demacritus and Epicurus: ‘ The atoms have these
three properties, shape, size and weight. Democritus gave them two, size
and shape, but Epicurns added weight to these as a third; for he said
that bodies must be carried on by the i1mpact ANy,                      kit “bloyv”] of
weight: otherwise they would not move.’
Eplcurus according to this, spoke of weight as a &amp;low, an unusual
<p>expression which sounds like a deliberate corrective use of the earlier
atomists’ terminology.         A speaker in Cicero’s De faro (20.46, 68'4 47)
asks what need the Epicureans have for the innovation of an ‘atomic
swerve’: ‘the atoms had another motive force, from Democritus the
impulse which he calls plagam [a blow], from you, Epicurus, the force
of gravity or weight’. Aétius (1.26.2, 68 A 66) speaks of the ‘repercus-
sion, motion and blow (tAny?) of matter’ in Democrits, and Sim~
plicius says that Democritus “made his atoms naturally motionless [i.e.
they had no ‘patural motion® in the Aristotelian sense] but said that
they moved by impact [blow, wAny#]". This is in keeping with the
verdict of Aristotle (De caelo, 300b 11, and Simplicius in his comment
on the passage) that the motion of atoms was ‘enforced’ (Pix), which
according to his own doctrine ought o presuppose a prior natural
motion. The difference on this point between Democritus and Epicurus
seems to have been well known. In Cicero’s De finthus we read
(1.6.17): ‘Democritus believed that the atoms move in infinite void,
in which there is neither top nor bottom nor centre nor extremity, in
such a way that they collide and cling together.” Not only does this,
like Aristotle at De caelo, 275b 29, appear to exclude downward motion
as inconceivable, but the speaker goes on to mention ‘errors peculiar
to Epicurus’, of which the first is to suppose that they are borne per-
pendicularly downwards by their weight.! The influence of Aristotle
  * Epicurus realized that bodies of different weights would fall chrough a vacuum at equal
speeds, and 10 account for thetr collisions endowed ¢he aroms with the independent power of
occasionally swerving minutely from their courses. We may agree that if Democritus Aad con-
ceived of the pre-cosmic motion as 2 fall, he would have been unaware of this point. Whether
Epicurus accused him of doing so, and was claiming to coreect him, 1s disputed. (Conerast</p>

<p>                               The Question of Weight
 and the Peripatetic tradition made it impossible to ignore the demand
 for a natural® motion of the atoms, logically even if not chronologically
 prior to the motions which they imparted to each other by their impact.
 No such demand presented itself to Democritus.
In Gen. et Corr. (326a9) on the other hand Aristotle says: ‘Each
<p> atom is heavier, the bigger it is.”<em> This is the only sentence in which
 Aristotle unambiguously attributes weight to the atoms,</em> but if he had
 not thought it right to do so, he would certainly have charged them, as
 he did the Pythagoreans and Plato, with producing weighty bodies
 from weightless elements, and this he never does. Moreover the
 sentence in Theophrastus, De sensu, 61, ‘Democritus distinguishes
 heavy and light by size” also refers to the atoms. This apparent contra-
 diction with the evidence considered so far is explained by a sentence
 in Simplicius (Cael. 569. 5, 68 461) which also says that the atoms have
 weight, but in a context which puts it beyond doubt thathe is describing
 the state of things within a cosmic vortex, not the behaviour of atoms
 floating freely in the void.3
 Railey, dromists, 313, with Alfieri, Atom. Id. 81, . 1.) If he did, we may be sure that he mis-
 understood him. (See Alfieri, Joc. cit.) Dyroff (Demokritstud. 38) argues that if each atom had
 weight, the “full” must continually fall into the bottomless, and the upper regions form an ever-
 increasing voud. Since not only space but also the aumber of atoms is infinite, this objection
 seems invalid, But the evidence aganst an onginal downward rain of atoms is so overwhelming
 that we need not trouble to invent hypothetical arguments on Democritus’s behalf.

<p>                       The Aromists of the Fifth Century
  We may conclude, then, that Leucippus and Democritus saw no
 reason to offer a positive cause for the motion of the atoms save the fact
 that they were free in infinite void, and that they did not assign to
~them any of the motions which Aristotle called ‘natural’. Motion was -
 to be accepted as an inherent and eternal characteristic of matter when
“unimpeded by any obstacle. It was a confused and irregular motion in
all directions, and since it was eternal and without beginning, it was as
reasonable to say that the collisions and rebounding of the atoms
determined their direction as that the random nature of the motion
caused the collisions. They move according, as they strike one another,’*
The ‘necessity’ which governs their motion and from time'to time
produces a cosmic vortex is ‘the repercussion and motion and impact
of matter’?
 These are the sole data required for producing (among countless
other systemns) a world like our own with its rocks and trees, men and
animals, births, changes and deaths, and all our sensations of sight and
sound, smell and taste. Atoms in motion account for it all. They say
that nature is subject to local motion,. . . but that the first bodies under-
go none of the other forms of change. These only affect their products,
which grow and waste away and alter by combination and separation
of the atoms’ (Arist. Phys. 265b25).</p>

recoiling of the atoms. Tt must always be remembered that, 2s there Was no beginning of ther

entangled     (meprmékesBon), thus generating perceptible bodies.
Aristotle’s brief statements of this (GC, 325a31 and 34; 315b6)"
are elaborated a little by Simplicius (Cael. 242.21, 67 A 14, partly
quoted already, p. 401 above): “These atoms, separate one from the
other in the void which is infinite, and differing in shape, size,
position and order, are in motion in the void, overtake one another
and collide. Some rebound at hazard, others become entangled
when their shapes, sizes, positions and order are favourable, and
thus it happens that they bring about the generation of composite
things.” Some of these shapes are enumerated in Simplicius’s quota-
ton from Aristotle (68 A 37): ‘some are irregular, some hooked,
some hollow, others convex, and others have innumerable other
differences’.
Since there is no limit either to the atoms or the void, many and
<p>various systems have been formed, of which our cosmos is only one.
Some have dissolved again, others coexist with ours.                    As a follower of
Demacritus picturesquely expressed it, it is as unlikely that a single
world should arise in the infinite as that one single ear of corn should
grow on a large plain.<em> Democritus himself, according to Hippolytus
(Ref- 1.13.2, A40), said that
there are innumerable worlds of different sizes. In some there is neither sun
nor moon, in others they are larger than in ours and others have more
than one. These worlds are at irregular distances, more in one direction
and less in another, and some are fourishing, others declining,                  Here they
come into being, there they die, and they are destroyed by collision with
one another.     Some of the worlds have no animal or vegetabie life nor any
water.
One cannot but admire a man whose scientific imagination reached
<p>so far beyond the limited experience of his time as to paint this picture
of an infinite variety of cosmic systems, in some ways so suggestive of
modern cosmological knowledge. We note also the complete emancipa-
  ¥ Aristotle credits Leucippus and Democritus (the latter, he says admiringly, ‘seems to have
thought of everything”) with having, alone among his predecessors, distinguished between
Yéveais kal gop&amp; and &amp;Aholwais: ylveois and gfopk are a matter of the combination and
separation of atoms (i.e. the formation and dissolution of compounds), whereas dholwais is an
alteration of their oxder and postion in 2 compound (GC, 31535, b6).

great void, and these when collected in a mass produce a single vortex,

<p>tioned by Diog, Laert. (9.31 and 44), Simplicius, Cael. 202,16 (67 A 21), and for ‘the aromists”
in general by Dionysius ap, Eus. P.E. 14.23 (68 &amp; 43). Cicero (4e. pr. 2.17.55) adds that some
of them are absolutely indistinguishable from each other. This may well be right, for it is logical
that infinite space, time and number of atoms should bave given rise to identical as well as to
different combinations. (Cf. Kerschensteiner, Kosmos, 166 with n. 2.) It may on the other hand
be due 1o a misunderstanding. Simplicius (Cael. 310. 15, 68 A 82) says, using Peripatetic language,

origin of the Timaeus motifs cannot be taken as proved. See DK, n, 83n., where the conclusion
that ‘the whole question needs to be gone into afresh’ is undoubtedly correct, as is Nestle’s that

in proportion to the resistance of the centre,5 and the membrane becomes
thin as the contiguous bodies continually flow together by contact in the
vortex, In this way the earth was formed, by the cohesion of the bodies
which had moved to the centre. The enclosing membrane in turn is aug-
mented by the influx of atoms from outside; and as it whirls around, it
adds to itself those that come into contact with it. Some of these become
interlocked and form a complex thar is wet and muddy at first, but drying out
as they are carried round in the universal vortex they finally catch fire and
form the substance of the stars..., All the stars are ignited by the speed of
their motion....Just as a cosmos is born, so also it grows, declines and
perishes by some sort of necessity, the nature of which he does not specify.</p>

how the whole structure itself can ‘stand apart like a membrane’ (KR), since it appears to consist
of all the atoms in the casmic vortex, from centre to circumference. Nevertheless, considering
the imperfections of this account it 1s not impossible that ovoTnua ggmpoadts is intended to
refer only to the outer spherical envelope formed by the linkage of haoked atams (67423).

<p>                          The Awomists of the Fifth Cenury
Lacking the work of Leucippus, we must make what we can of this
<p>compilation from an epitome of Theophrastus’s version of what
Leucippus said. The reminder should be a check to dogmatism. One
obstacle to understanding might still have faced us if we were reading
the atomist himsell. From this and other passages it is obvious that he
and Democritus described the formation of a world in terms appropri-
ate to the birth of an animal, and this may well have led to the omission
or blurring of certain links which we should expect to find in a chain
of mechanical processes. That the process was in their eyes a mechanical
one we need not doubt. If Democritus called man a miniaturk cosmos
(fr. 34), his intention was to assimilate the processes of organicto those
of inorganic nature, not vice versa, Yet the assimilation was made under
the influence of earlier cosmogonies, like that of Anaximander, which
saw the world as a living and growing organism, and this mode of
thought was not completely outgrown. The world’s outer envelope is
a membrane (Uunv, &amp;ymen) such as encloses the foetus in the womb.!
Worlds grow to maturity,? then become senile and finally die.
A world, then, is formed thus. From all eternity there is an infinite
<p>number of atoms of different shapes moving in infinite space with an
irregular and aimless motion, and so at irregular distances. Where a
large interval of space happens to be empty of them, a whole lot of
atoms pours in and for a reason not stated sets up a circular eddy.                                It
may be simply that with an infinity of space and of atoms and all
eternity for them to move in, every variety of motion must have resulted
from their contact somewhere, sometime.                            Only when it takes this
circular form does a cosmos result. Though all atoms within reach are
drawn into the general pattern of the whirl, they are still constantly
tumbling over one another and performing all sorts of gyrations within
* The word xrméw, which Leucippus and Demacritus are also said to have used 1n this con-
<p>nexion (Aét. 2.7.3, 67423), had the same meaning. See Kerschensteiner, loc. cit. 444 and cf.
p- 254, n T above. Upfy was also used of the skin or membrane immediately inside the shell
of an egg, and in spite of the Jateness of our immediate source it is suggesuive that an Orphic
account compares the order of the universe ta that in an egg: as the shell is to the egg, so 15 the
outermost heaven ta the umiverse, and as the aither is suspended all round from the heaven, so is
the Guriv from the shell. (The source is the Jsagoge of Achilies. See DK, 1, p. 11 or Kern, Orph,
Fr. 70, p. 156, p. 190 above,   Uudy could also mean the shell itself before it had hardened, Arist,
GA, 752232.) These nations are older than Leucippus.

<p>                                Aetion of Like on Like
it.t At this point a cardinal law of atomism begins to operate: like
tends towards like, and like acts upon like. This law, originating in
the motion of atoms, and so limited to resemblances in size and shape,
canbe seen to operate in both the organicand the inorganic worlds. The
chief locus is Democritus fr. 164, where Sextus quotes him as illustrating
the law in the animal world by the tendency of creatures of the same
species to herd together, and in inanimate things by the action of
sieving and the disposal of pebbles washed up by waves on the beach.
Although in the analogy of the sieve he mentions lentls, wheat and
barley grains, the essential differences are not those of kind, but of
shape, as the pebbles indicate (‘the long pebbles are brought to the
same place as other long ones, and round to round, as if their similarity
had some attractive power’) and as Aétius in his paraphrase says.<em> That
like acts on like is attested by Aristotle (GC, 323b10):
Democritus. . .says that agent and patient are the same or similar: it is
impossible for disparate things to act on each other, but if; though different,
they should nevertheless have some mutual effect, this occurs not because
they are different but in so far as they have some common                            characteristic.
Aristotle calls this a doctrine peculiar to Democtitus alone, which is at
first surprising, for it appears prominently in Empedocles and in the
separation of unlikes in the cosmogonic revolution of Anaxagoras.
The explanation may be that for the atomist the claim that there is no
' So 1 interpret mpoaxpolovta kal wovTobamws kukhoupeva, which Hammer-Jensen, and foliow-
<p>ing her Alfient (Aromusei, 4, 0. 12), regard as evidence thac the &amp;wn is not a crcular vortex but an
irregular shaking as of a sieve (or rather of a winnowing-fan, since these scholars argue from the
wwhéravoy of Plato’s Thnaeus to the kéowwvov of Democritus).         Since its product is the present
watld with its revolving sky set wich the heavenly bodies,     we should have to suppose two sorts
of Blvn, # Tal Shov Sivn which carries the circling stars having quite a different motion from the
Blvn set up at the birth of the cosmos. Thus is surely impossible.   Its chief support is the quite un~
proven assumption that the atomists’ 8fvy was the model for the chaotic motion of Plato, Tim.
sze. But Plato is describing pre-cosmic motion, and if, as is possible, he had the atomists’ system
in muind, it is surely with their pre-cosmic motion thae his own should be compared, not with the
Bivn that is the heginning of a cosmos.
  No doubt, as Sextus says (Democr. fr, 164), to ilustrate the doctrine of ‘like to like” Demo-
critus used the metaphor of sieving, but it 1s no more necessary to suppose on this account that
the cosrue Sivn tesembled the mouon of a sieve than that it undulated like the waves of the sea,
which, says Sextus immediacely after, Democritus instanced as having a similar effect.

difference between agent and patient, but everthing happens by mutual
influence of similars, excludes the possibility of exrernal agents like the
Love and Strife of Empedocles and the Mind of Anaxagoras. The inter-
action, springing as it does from the eternal motion of the atoms, is
without external cause.” Tts reality is argued from observation of what
happens in the macroscopic world.
In accordance with this law atoms of similar shape and size draw
<p>together, and as more and more crowd into the vortex disturbances
occur and those with less resistance are forced to the outer reaches and
even beyond. Diogenes may be supplemented here by the Epicurean-
izing exposition of Aétius (r.4.2, 67 A 24):                    '
As these atoms crowded together in the same space, the larger ald heavier
sank down in all sorts of ways, while the small, round, smooth and slippery
were squeezed out in the concourse of atoms and carried to the upper regions.
Shape as well as size is a fagtor, and with size goes weight as the
atomists     conceived it; that is, a tendency                to seek the centre          of the
eddy, and a power of resistance to the impact of other atoms by
which smaller and less heavy atoms could be displaced to great
distances.
The atoms are of the same substance and have weight, but because some are
heavier the lighter ones are forced out by these as they sink down, and are
borne upwards. This, they say, is how some bodies seem to be light and
others heavy.<em>
The model for the vortex was an eddy of wind or water, in which
heavier bodies do gather in a heap at the centre while lighter ones are
carried away.3
At the circumference of the spherical whirling mass which is an
<p>embryo universe, a skin is formed comparable to the caul round a
foetus, being ‘woven together out of the hook-shaped atoms’ (Aét.

(with the reservarion made in the previous note).
# Simpl. Ceel. 569.5. Simplicius writes in the Peripatetic belief that some elements (fire and
<p>air) are absolutely light, i.e. have a natural motion away from the centre of the universe. This is
the belief which fie represents Democritus as denying. CE. ibid. 712.27: fire according to Dema-
critus has Jess weight, hence gets squeezed out and appesrs to have actual lightness.        (Both
passages in DK, 684 61.)

2.7.2,67 4 23).         Tts formation is assisted by the addition of similar
atoms from outside, and although small atoms are being constantly
extruded from within, these presumably do not assist its growth to any
great extent since the atoms subject to extrusion are primarily smooth
and round, not hooked. The idea that the world is surrounded by a
skin or membrarne is strange to us and not particularly helpful to the
atomists’ own scheme. It was of course an inherited and deeply seated
belief. To stop short of mythical cosmogonies which thought of it as
a huge egg, the outer sphere of flame in Anaximander was described by
a word which can mean either bark or skin, and either a skin or a hard
surface is assumed by Anaximenes, Parmenides and Empedocles.? In
the atomic picture there are of course interstices between the linked
atoms,? and the snatching up of atoms from outside is also a peculiar
feature.
The formation of the heavenly bodies, as Diogenes relates it, is not
<p>very clear. Some of the atoms which are caught up in the whirl cling
together and form sizeable concentrations. Why these should be wet
and muddy is not stated.               In the system of Anaxagoras there was a
good reason, for they were lumps of the earth which had been flung
into the sky at an early stage in its formation, and it looks as if they
have retained the property without the justification for it. Anaxagorean
also is the explanation of their catching fire from the rapidity of their
rotation.3 All this is not very easy to explain in atomic terms. What is
wet and earthy is composed of large atoms, whereas fire is a body
consisting of spherical atoms of the smallest size. These are just the
kind to be ‘squeezed out’ by the others, and their squeezing out is no
doubt intended to explain the universally accepted fact that the bulk
of fire in the universe is located in its outer regions, Presumably alarge
number of these become incorporated in the formerly muddy bodies as
they whirl around, but from the meagre statement offered here we can

that Democritus did not use the word ‘contact’ of atoms in its strict sense, ‘but what he called
contact was proximity, for they were in every case separated by the void®. Unless this is entirely
erroneous (as Zeller thought, ZN, ra6g, n. 5 ad fin.), it sefers to the fact that owing to their

<p>                        The Atomists of the Fifth Century
only guess at Leucippus’s explanation. As it is, the novel idea that the
matter of the stars is of extra-cosmic origin seems to sit rather un-
comfortably on the Anaxagorean conception of it as earthy and wet.
In general such material collected at the cenire, as in other cosmogonies,
and gradually built up the earth.<em> This, at least in the system of Demo-
critus, was formed before the stars (Hippol. Ref. 1.13.4, 68 A 40).
Democritus may have tried to introduce more consistency into
<p>Leucippus’s account at this point. Diogenes states explicitly (9.44)
that the fiery nature of the sun and moon is due to the presence in them
of atoms of the appropriate type, round and smooth, but the only other
information, in a passage of the Stromazeis (68 A 39), is not aliogether
clear. After affirming that, as in Leucippus, the sun and moon at
their birth were neither hot nor bright but like earth, it goes on to
say that ‘as the sun’s circle increased in size fire became incorporated
in it’.    Perhaps then the sun and moon                      were not, in Democritus’s
system, formed from extra-cosmic matter, and their originally cold
and earthy nature was connected with their moving in smaller orbits,
nearer to the earth, and only becoming ignited as they swung further
into the outer regions where they would meet with the small round
fire-atoms.?
 The destruction of worlds by collision has already been mentioned.
<p>In the same section Hippolytus adds a little about their acme and
decline: ‘ They flourish until they are unable 1o take in any more from
outside.” Here again one can detect an echo of other cosmogonies
based on the conception of the world as a living and growing organism,
for it recalls the idea of the ‘nourishment’ of the stars in Heraclitus, and

were originally the centres of independent waorld-systems as the earth is of ours. This, and the
suppasition that the sun became fiery as its orbit increased, can, he thought, be reconcited with
the rest of the stomic cosmogony on the assumption that sun and moon were at an earlier stage
of their formation caught up by the masses whirling round the earth as centre and so hrought into
our own system.   I cannot understand this, nor see how fus final assumption fits with the ariginally

of the cosmos        in Philolaus.”         Nevertheless,       the persistence of this
pattern of the world's growth must not make us forget that for the
atomists it was no longer a living thing.<em> It was                   an undesigned com-
bination of atoms subject to an apparently random motion which had
happened to take certain directions under a purely mechanical com-
pulsion. The various kinds of movement which worked together to
produce it may be summarized as follows: (1) a universal vortex to
which minor movements are subordinace; (2) within this, a continu-
ance of the original irregular motions of individual atoms resulting
from their collisions and recoil; (3) a tendency of larger and heavier
bodies to seek the centre of the vortex and smaller and lighter ones to
be squeezed outwards;3 (4) more generally, the attraction of like to
like, a law applicable bath to single atoms and to their compounds.
All this Leucippus and Democritus attributed to ‘necessity’, a concept
which, so their ancient critics say, was left unexplained but was in
effect no different from chance. The relation between these two con-
cepts is worth a somewhat closer study. (See §7 below.)
                              (6) The four elements
<p>The prominence of the four elements in Greek philosophy has made it
seem important to many scholars to consider their status in atomism.
Obvicusly there can be no question of truly elemental bodies except
the atoms. Moreover, since the atoms are of infinitely different shapes
and sizes, they cannot build up into four primary kinds of bodily
substance which were the basis of all others, as did Plato’s elementary
particles which were confined to the shapes of four of the regular solids.
Nevertheless, since earth, water, air and fire always held a special place
in the Greek mind and had recently been given elemental status by
Erapedocles,       Leucippus       and    Democritus        would      presumably        make
some attempt to explain their differences by atomic composition.
That their atoms diflered in size is obvious from the way the universe

  <em> In what follows I have had particularly in mind the views of Zeller (ZN, 1075),    Hammer-
Jensen (Archiv. 1910, 212), Alfieri (dtom. Jd. 177 £.) and Kerschenstemer (Kosmos, 164£).

<p>                       The Atomists of the Fifih Century
was formed: large and heavy atoms form the earth, specially light and
mobile ones fly outward and become fire, and the atoms of the inter-
mediate bodies water and air must be of cotrespondingly intermediate
size. Only of fire, so far as we know, did Democritus specify a shape,
namely round and smooth,” and even then it must be remembered that
the atoms of soul, and of anything sweet-flavoured, are also round.
Yet one may assumne that the atoms of a stable substance like earth
must have been hooked or burr-like in comparison with fluids or
vapours. The two points that only fire was allotted a special shape, and
that there was no essential distinction between the ‘elements’and other
atomic compounds, are borne out by several passages. Aristotle says
that, while assigning the sphere to fire, the atomists did not define the
shapes of the atoms forming the other elements: “air, water and the rest
they distinguished by size, considering their nature to be a panspermia
(seed-collection) of all the elements|i.e. atoms]’. Plutarch, after describ-
ing the atoms of Democritus, continues: ‘and when they approach each
other or collide or get entangled, the result of the concourse appears in
one case as fire, in another water, in another a plant or a man’. Aristotle
may have used the word panspermia somewhat carelessly (it seems more
appropriate to the theory of Anaxagoras), but it is a reasonable con-
clusion that the atomists did not assign a definite shape to the atoms of
the other three ‘elements’ and that they spoke of air and water, plants
and men, as compounds on much the same level.?
                (7) Causality in atomism.: necessity and chance
<p>No cause or force was required to set the atoms in motion originally,
for their motion is eternal. For the course which their movement takes
(on which depends all that happens in the world), both necessity and
chance are alleged as causes.3 They are clearly very similar conceptions,
  </p>
</p>
</em> Even after Newton it was possible for his follower Boerhaave 10 think of fire as a body,
composed of especiaily fine, round, smooth and polished particles, without hooks, projections,
ar indentations (Toulmin, 4rek. of Marter, 211).

and this may cause surprise at first sight, since we tend to contrast them
strongly as what produces invariable results with what is unpredictable
and haphazard in its effects. Yet although ‘necessity’ and ‘chance’ are
reasonable translations of the relevant Greek words, the Greeks saw
things so differently that to them the expression ‘necessary chance’ was
perfectly natural.<em> Aristotle was not cheating when he at the same time
spoke of the earlier natural philosophers as disallowing a teleological
view of nature by attributing everything to necessizy (‘ rain falls because
vapour when drawn up rmust cool, and when cooled must become water
and descend again”) and criticized this position by an argument designed
to show that natural events are not at the mercy of chance, but exhibit
a certain constancy and regularity. How this could be so we shall see.
Necessity was all-potent for Leucippus and Democritus. In a
<p>sentence     hard     to     transpose       into    another           tongue,       Leucippus           said:
‘Nothing occurs at random,? but everything for a reason and by
necessity.” ‘ Democritus,” said Aristotle, ‘ignoring the final cause, refers
all the operations of nature to necessity.’3 The origin, development and
decay of worlds is due to necessity, with which are equated all the
myriad collisions and recoils of atoms among each other, and in par-
ticular the cosmic vortex into which they are drawn.# Chance as a
cause of physical events in atomism is mentioned only by commentators

<p>                      The Awomists of the Fifth Century
Aristotle speaks of some who ‘allege chance (Té oropearov) as the
cause of this heaven and all the worlds; for they say that the vortex,
the movement which separated and brought the whole to its present
order, arose by chance’. This, he comments, is odd: they cannot
ascribe the smaller details of nature to chance (éxn; it is not a matter of
chance what kind of plant will grow from a particular seed), and it is
illogical to suppose that chance produced the universe at large but
regular causation governs the sphere of plants and animals ;which are
dependent on the larger cosmic motions (Phys. 196az4fL).4
To understand the atomists’ conception of necessity we ‘must take
<p>account of the point of view from which Aristatle was crificizing it.
He wrote as a teleologist, who sees natural processes in the light of
their ends, to which the earlier stages must be thought of as means.
Even if one cannot identify a designing mind at work, yet all the stages
of growth from a seed to an oak-tree can only be understood in the light
of the ‘form’ of the tree regarded as pre-existing and governing their
direction, just as as the pre-existing plans in the mind of an architect, or
committed by him to paper, must conwrol the subsequent process of
building. To this view the blind necessity of atomic motion, seeing
events as determined by the inchoate and not the final state, wasin direct
opposition. For the mechanists, says Aristotle, nature does not act in
a particular way because it is better, and subserves an end, but as rain
falls, that is, by the necessity inherent in the properties of moisture, heat
and so on, not in order to make crops grow. Indeed, it may sometimes
destroy them. Whichever it does, the result is only accidental: the
cause is blind, mechanical necessity.!
 Against this he appeals to the constancy of nature.                       Natural events
<p>follow certain Jaws, either invariably or at least with a prevailing regu-
larity. A poppy-seed always produces a poppy, pever a thistle. In
Greece it is regularly hot and dry in July, cool and wet in the wiater.
Hence natural events cannot be due to chance. If there is a rainstorm
 in July we do attribute it to chance, just because it is exceptional. The
 arguments of those who attribute everything to necessity ‘cannot be</p>
</p>
</p>
 * Schumacher’s contention (Ant. Medizin, 141) that the aciology of the atomists does not
<p> exclude final causation has little to recommend it and would be refuted by Aristotle’s opposition
 alone.</p>
                                            416
<p>                          Chance and Necessity
true, becanse natural events happen always or usually in the same way,
and this cannot be true of [necessary events? No, but] chance events.’
(198b32fL.)
This looks like a blatant shifting of ground. How can one quote the
<p>view thar all nature is governed by necessity and claim to refute it on
the ground that its warking does nat seem to be governed by chance?
Such a shift offers a temptation to the teleologist, since for him there
are only rwo alternatives: things either happen at random, in which
case they are ruled by chance, or with regularity, which for him is
tantamount ta proof that they are purpaseful. The third hypothesis, of
a purposeless but unvarying force called necessity, does not exist.
(Cf. 199a3.)
Yet the existence of phrases like ‘necessary chance” in Greek sug-
<p>gests thart there is more to it than mere misunderstanding. The early
natural philosophers conceived of necessity as an internal cause rather
than a cause relating two or more events to each other. To us, problems
of causation in science are concerned with the explanation of sequences,
chains of cause and effect linking together x and y and 7. The Greek on
the other hand investigated what he called ‘the namre of things’, and
asked himself ‘what is it iz x that causes it to behave as it does?’ He
would ask a similar question abouty and 7, but they would be separate
questions. There is a necessity governing the hehaviour of fire and
causing it to fly upwards (it is the same as the physis of fire), and a
necessity governing the downward movement of earth. Hence the
direction each takes is invariable. But whether a particular portion of
fire will meet a particular piece of earth, and what will happen if it does,
this doctrine does not say. Such events it appears that the atomists
referred to chance. By this they did not mean that their coming-to-pass
had no relation to necessary causes, but only that it owed its origin to
a nexus of necessary causes so complex that it was beyond human
powers ever to comprehend it. Chance was something subjective,
exceeding our powers of prediction, because the necessary causes
involved were (not non-existent, but) indefinite in pumber. Obviously
if we had complete understanding of the motions of fire in general and
every portion of fire in particular, and an equally complete under-
standing of the necessity governing, in general and in parricular, every

portion of every natural body with which fire ever comes into contact,
we could predict accurately the moment and the spot at which a forest
fire would start in the Australian bush.                  But equally obviously, such
omniscience is beyond our reach.
 In Physics B, chapter 4, Aristotle describes three conceptions                             of
<p>chance which were current among his predecessors, Curiously enough,
there are good grounds for thinking that all three are different aspects of
the view held by Democritus.<em> First comes the view that there is no
such thing and that everything that is said to happen by chance has in
fact its own determinaic              cause.     Aristotle’s pupil Eudemus,              whom
Simplicius quotes on this passage, referred this to Democritu$ on the
ground that, even if he appears to employ chance as a cause in his
cosmogony, in detail he ascribes all events to other causes (Simpl.
Phys. 330.14, 68. 4 68). Take the analogy of a man who, wishing to
plant an olive tree, digs a hole and comes upon a treasure. This, said
Democritus, we call chance or luck, but it had its cause in the need to
plant the tree, and (we may add) if we knew also the reason why the
owner of the treasure buried it there, we should have a full explanation.
  The second view, already quoted, is vouched for as Democritean by
its references to the cosmogonic vortex and the plurality of worlds. It
is the view that the origin of the world seems due to chance but the
growth of things on earth exhibits regularity.
 From these hints, given with a teleologist’s bias, we may reconstruct
<p>the atomists’ notion of causation.                Objectively there is no such thing
as chance, but everything is subject to a strict law of mechanical
necessity, as Leucippus said. Within this universally operating neces-
sity, the human investigator distinguishes berween what are z0 im two
different kinds of causation, that which brought about </p>
</em>this heaven and
all the worlds” and that which operates in the germination of a seed.
Germination does not seem to be a chance or haphazard process because
when we examine the seed we can safely predict what it is going to
become. The difference between such an event and the great cosmic
events which, it seems, the atomists did attribute to chance, is that the
 * Some may feel difficulty in believing this on the formal ground that when Aristotle writes

latter contain features which make them unpredictable by man. The
whirl is created by necessity, and as the millions of atoms move in
space and collide, there is in reality a strict mechanical cause for the
behaviour of each one. Yet we could never predict the fate of an
individual atom, whether it will be drawn into the whirl or not, as we
can predict the development of a seed. Chance as a subjective notion
can take its place in the system without prejudice to the ruling idea of
an all-pervading necessity.
In this way it approximates to the third of the views reported by
<p>Aristotle in this chapter, that chance is ‘a cause obscure to human
understanding’. True, he adds “as being something divine and miracu-
lous’, which must refer not to the atomists but rather to popular beliefs
about fortune.” But the definition of chance as simply a cause that is
beyond human understanding is ascribed to Democritus (along with
Anaxagoras and the Stoics) by Aétius in practically the same words.?
We conclude that Democritus’s theory of causality comprised the
<p>following three points:
(1) Every event is determined. There is no such thing as chance if
<p>the term is used in an absolute or objective sense.
(2) The notion of chance may be retained and used in a qualified
<p>sense to mean a cause which is, and must remain, obscure to us.
(3) The incomprehensibility of such a cause lies in the fact that it is
<p>always, so far as we are concerned, one of an indefinitely large number
of possibilities.</p>

the earth, the two atomists differed. Leucippus (D.L. 9.33) went back
t0 Anaximander in supposing that the sun’s orbit was outermost, but
put the fixed stars next, and the moon nearest the earth. The reason for
the position of the sun may have been (though it is not mentioned in any
ancient authority) that as the brightest and hottest body it must be
where the speed of the revolution is greatest.<em>
Democritus on the other hand is reported to have adopted the
<p>normal order, putting the fixed stars furthest away, and also to have
distinguished the various orbits of the planets. For him ‘the planets
themselves are not all at the same height’, says Hippoljius (Ref:
1.13.4, A 40), and another version of his order is ‘first [i.e. outer-
most] the fixed stars, then the [other] planets, and after them sun,
Venus, moon” (Aét. 2.15 .3, 4 86). The titles of Democritus’s works
include one devoted to the planets, which indicates a special incerest,
and on the most likely interpretation of a passage in Seneca (Nat.
gi. 7.3.2, A92) he knew their names and order and suspected the
existence of others as yet undiscovered. The clear distinction between
planets and fixed stars, and attribution of differing orbits to the former,
was ignored by T .eucippus, though the advance can scarcely have been
due to Democritus himself.</p>

<p>questioning the proximity of the moon 10 the earth. For a possible Persian origin of these unusual
speculations about the arrangement of the heavenly bodies, see the references in W. Burkert,
Rk, Mus. 1963, 104, n. 212.
* Anaximander did not distinguish the orbits of the planets fram those of the fixed scars (vol. t,
<p>94)- Anaximenes probably did (see now Burkert, Weisheir u. Wiss. 290, n. 71), bur if so it
was in the context of an extremely childish astronomy (vol. 1, 135). According to Eudemus the
order of the planets was first determined by ‘the Pythagoreans’ (iid. 93, 298), which is vague
a5 to date, buc it may be thought to go with the docrrine of theharmony of the spheres (ibid. 296).
However, see ibid. 300 on the original form of this doctrine, Permenides's theory of the
atepdvan (pp. Gz2f. above), though inadequately and obscurely described in our sources, no
doubt   involves   the distinction   between   fixed stars and    planets, which   is also recorded   for
Empedocles (454, p. 92 above), For Anaxagoras we have no information except for his use
of the word ‘planets’ in connexion with comets. (See p. 309 above and Burkert,
                                                                          loc. git.0. 74.) On
<p>the passage in Seneca see now Burkert, op. ciz. 292, It seems probable that Seneca misunder-
stood his source in supposing that the number and rames of the five planets were not known
in Democriws’s day. (This was first suggested by Zeller, ZN, 1107, n. 2 2d fin.). They had of
course long been known in the eastern lands in which he is said to have travelled.        Burkert from
his anti-Pythagorean      viewpoint conducts      2 sprited      defence   of Democritus’s   astranomy
 against those who, like Burnet and Heath, have dismissed it as childish and reactionary.</p>

means that the sun is outstripped by the stars and the moon by the sun,
and this gives us the illusion that sun and moon are moving in the
reverse direction through the zodiac, at different speeds, while the
fixed stars remain still.”
The stars according to Leucippus are ignited by the rapidity of their
<p>movement, ‘and the sun’, adds our source (D.L. 9.33), ‘is also ignited
by the stars’, i.e., presumably, as well as by its motion. Bailey suggests
that the dual causation was intended to account for its superior bright-
ness. Leucippus’s ideas on these mattets seetn to have been remarkably
naive, though we must allow for the inadequacy and inferioriry of our
source. The moon, we are told, ‘has only a little fire’. Such as it has
appears to be its own, and Leucippus either did not know or dis-
believed the discovery of Anaxagoras that it derived its light from the
sun.? Democritus accepted from Anaxagoras the view that the moon
resembled the earth in containing ‘glens and valleys’, and said that we
see in it the shadows of the higher parts (Aét. 2.25.9, A90); and a
passage in Plutarch, which is otherwise not free from obscurity, at
least makes plain that he knew it to be illuminated by the sun.3 He is

such docerines at Athens in the climate of the time was dangerous, he adds.             It is however just
possible that Leucippus did follow Anaxagoras here, far our information is meagre, and Anaxa-
goras, even though he knew the moon got 1ts light from the sun, still held that it conrtained some
fire itself. (See p. 307 above.)
   3 De facie, 929¢. The speaker is refuting the notion (which he does not ascribe to any authority
<p>by name) that the moon is transparent, “like glass or ice’, and lets the sun shine through it. Afrer
stating one ohjection he goes on (trans. Cherniss): <em> Certainly her deviations or aversions cannot
be alleged a5 the cause of her invisibility when she is in conjunction, as they are when she is at
the half and gibbous or crescent; then rather, “standing in a straight line with her illuminant”,
as Demacritus says, </em>she suscains and receives the sun”, so that it would be reasonable for her to
be visible and to let him shine through.” This, as he goes on to point ou, is the reverse of what
happens, s0 once again the hypothesis of a transparent moon is defeated. Bailey (Jroméses, 151)
is entirely wrong in supposing alt the rest of the sentence to belong to Democritus, and so making
him responsible for the ‘extraordiaary notion’ that the sun’s light is seen through the moon. The
maa who thought of the moon as earthy in appearance, with glens and valleys, can hardly have
believed that, nor does Plutarch say he did.

and of comets. He defended the theory of comets as an apparently
contiguous collection of planetary stars by maintaining that at their
dissolution the separate stars have sometimes been seen to appear.
 The     earth.      Leucippus      retained      the familiar flat round             (‘drum-
<p>shaped’, D.L. 9. 30 and Aét. 3.10.4, A26) earth, bur Democritus had
the original idea that it was ‘elongated, of length one and a half times
its breadth’.<em> He also said, like Archelaus (p. 342 above), that it was
concave, in which respect he is contrasted with Anaxagoras. (See DK,
59 A 87, 68 A 94.) Leucippus said that it was ‘borne rotating ‘about the
centre’ (D.L. 9.30), whereas according to Democritus (A&amp;t 3.13.4,
4.95) ‘at first it strayed about, being small and light, but as in time it
grew thicker and heavier, it came to rest’. Any rotatory movement
inust have been slow, for all bodies, as we have seen, move more
slowly as they near the centre owing to its ‘resistance’ to the cosmic
whirl; and so far as our sketchy reports go, it is possible that Demo-
critus visualized a revolving earth as did Leucippus.                        lts settling at the
centre of the universe is contrasted with its ‘straying about’ in the

s0 that the tilung of the earth towards the south explains both phenomena: eclipses are ‘due 10
the passing of sun and moon behind the raised northern paris of the world”, their orbits being
horizontal. If this is so, it makes the conjectured reference to the ecliptic unnecessary. Leucippus
also noted that the moon was eclipsed more often ¢han the sun, and attributed this to </em>the in-
equality of their orhirs”,

however, 1o have got much of his information from Erarosthenes), and the word mpoufikns
alone in Eustathius. (See Democritus fr. 15 and A94.) The former contrasts Democritus with
the earlier writers who wrote of the earth as round, with Delpht as its centre.        Aézius on the
other hand (3.10.5, A94) uses the word Sioxcalis.
Bailey (A4omises, 151£.) suggests that Democritus was influenced by the theory about the
<p>Milky Way which he shared with Anaxagoras, making the earth conform more to its contours.
Lowenheim (Wissenschaft D.s, 981.) argues with some plausibility that Demoeritus knew of
<p>the doctrine of a sphenical earth and consciously rejected it. This would be in keeping with his
Ionian, un-Pythagorean leanings, and Aristotle, Czel. 293b32 ., shows that the two views were
rivals. The flac-earth party adduced the fact that the sun at its setting and rising shows a swaight,
not curved, line, where 1t 1s cut by the horizon. But Lowenheim’s general reasoning is weakened
by his translating Téprcvoy as ‘ Kesselpauke” and assuming it to be hemispherical. He does not
mention    the flat tambourine,   which appears    on vase-paintings, bas-reliefs, etc. and   was the
commonest, if not the only, form of the instrument.

revolve.r Whether this hypothesis of an earth still rotating under the
residual influence of the vortex is solely Leucippus’s or adopted by
Democritus, neither of them believed the earth to be a sphere, and there
is nothing to suggest that they related the fact to the apparent motions
of the heavenly bodies.               One cannot credit them with the brifliant
notion, propounded by the early fourth century, that the apparent
movement of the stars could be explained on the hypothesis of a
rotating earth and motionless heavens (vol. 1, 327£.). This information
about the earth raises two incidental points of interest. It illustrates the
atomists’ conception of weight as a tendency towards the centre of the
vortex and a power of resistance to external disturbance, and it shows
that the vortex is in a horizontal plane relative to the earth.
Empedocles, Anaxagoras and Archelaus had explained the angle
<p>between the zenith and the celestial pole by the supposition thar the
outer shell of the cosmos had at some time taken a tilt. Leucippus and
Democritus on the other hand taught that it was the earth that had
tilted. The canse of this phenomenon, as reported, shows a lively
imagination op Demoeritus’s part: ‘Because the southerly part of the
surrounding [atmosphere] is weaker, the earth as it grew tilted in that
direction; for the northerly parts are intemperate, the southern tem-
perate, hence it grew heavier in the latter quarter where it is abundant
in fruits and produce.’<em> The warmth rarefies the air (a connexion of
thought that goes back to Anaximenes), and makes it less able to sup-

</em> Chermss (4CP, 202, n. 230) thinks it hkety that <em>all who beheved the cosmos to be a whirling
eddy with earth at the centre {(Anaximander, Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, the Atamists) thought of
the flat earth as rotating about its short axis which is the centre of the eddy (cf. Burnet, EGP3,
Pp- 66, n. 3; p. 300, n. 1), 50 that strictly they did not think che earth immobile save in so far as it
does not move away from the centre of the whirl’. T have my doubts about Anaximander and
Anaxagoras {p. 302, n. 2 above and vol. 1, 9p), and unformnately he does not discuss our present
passage from Aetius. But ic may well be true about Demacritus, and if the nation of the 8fvn
originated from observation of eddies in water (p. 410 above), the belief that matter collected at
the centre still revolved, though slowly, would be a natural one.

</em> Aét. 3.12.2, A96. The explanation given for Leucippus in the same section (67A27) is
similar in essentials: the air in the south 15 ‘thin” because of the earth’s tntense heat there, in con-
trast to the frozen north. But there is no menttan of vegetation, and wenupwubvew seems to
exclude it. Did Democritus not share the common belief thar the torridity of the extreme south
was as “intemperate’ as the cold of the North? For the tilting of the sky in Empedocles and the
others see pp. 1911, 305, 342 above. [t seems the better explanation, since as Zeller remarked
(2N, 1108, n. 6), on the atomists’ view it is hard to see why all water does pot flow south and
flood the southern lands.</p>

port the southern half of the earth, which accordingly sinks. This con-
firms Aristotle’s statement that for Democritus, as for Anaximenes and
Anaxagoras, the earth owed its support in the centre of the cosmos to
the air, on which, owing 10 irs flatness, it ‘settled like a 1id”.<em> The
brilliant conjecture of Anaximander, that it remained there in equi-
librium simply because, being equidistant from all points on the circum-
ference of the cosmos, it had no reason to move in one direction rather
than another, is attributed to him along with Parmenides                                     by Aétius;
but the testimony of Aristotle must be preferred, and it is hkely that
the passage in Aétius contains some confusion.?
As recorded             by Aristotle,        Democritus’s          account       of edrthquakes
<p>seems to be based on Anaximenes, for they are caused by heavy rain
or drought. The earth, as for Anaxagoras, contains cavities (kofhicu
Aristotle, cor- va Seneca) full of water. When rain overfills them, the
water breaks out and causes the earthquake. Conversely, a rush of
water causing an earthquake may be brought about when the earth dries
out and the water is drawn from the fuller to the empty parts.3
Another return to the previous century is seen when Democritus
<p>maintains Anaximander’s theory that the sea is getting smaller and will
finally dry up.</p>

 Mereorology: magnetism. Most theories of wind of which we have
<p>any record, down to and including Aristotle, speak in terms of the
effect of heat on moisture, or of warming or cooling of the air causing
condensation or rarefaction; but Democritus, it seems, offered an
extremely simple explanation based directly on the restless dance of the
atoms: where there are few in a large space, the aic is still, bur a multi-
tude crowded into a small space collide, rebound, stick together, get
compressed, and this disturbance generates wind when the originally
confused motion sets in a particular predominating direction (Seneca,
Nat, gu. 5.2, 68 &amp; 93a).
The statementof Leucippus’s theory of thunder (‘ the violentbreaking
<p>out of fire enclosed in very thick clouds’) reads like a conflation of Anaxi-
mander with Anaxagoras.®&gt; Democritus differed. A scanty summary
of his views on some meteorological phenomena is preserved in Aétius
(3.3-11, 493), from which it wonld appear that he was at pains to re-
state eatlier Ionian theories in terms appropriate to atomism. The general
basis seems to be Anaxagoras’s downward rush of fire (p. 312 above).
Thunder is caused by an uneven combination of atoms forcing the cloud
which encloses it in a downward direction: lightning is a collision of clouds
owing to which the fire-producing particles gather together as they rub one
another through the many void apertures into a single spot and filter
through. A thunderbolt is produced when the downward motion is forced
in a cloud by fire-producing particles which are purer and finer and more even
and, as he says himself, close-fitted” (rukvépuova). Waterspouts (presteres)
occur when combinations of fire with more void are caught in places full of
void and in a kind of peculiar membrane which surrounds them, and then
forming into bodies owing to this mixture of many elements, swoop down
upon the deep.3

With Democritus the Empedoclean            pores and effluences’ explana-
<p>tion of magnetism acquires consistency, now that for the first time a
true     void   has   been   unambiguously    posited.    He   also   forestalled
Alexander’s question why the iron followed the magnet and not wice
versa. The latter’s statement affords a good example of the extra-~
ordinary contortions to which Democritus was prepared to resort in
applying his general principles to minor phenomena (Alex. Quaest.
2.23, AI65):                                                          i
Democritus also says that there are efluences and that like bodies ajre artracted
to like, but adds that all are attracted to a void. Having made these hypo-
theses, he supposes that the lodestone and iron consist of similar atoms, but
those of the stone are smaller and it is of rarer texture than the iron and con-~
tains more void. For this reason, its atoms being more mobile are attracted
more guickly to the iron (for they are moving to their similars), and entering
the pores of the iron disturb the atoms in it as they pass berween owing to
their small size. The atoms of the iron, thus disturbed, stream outside
towards the stone because of their similarity and because it has more void.
The iron [as a whole] follows them in their wholesale expulsion and move-
ment and is itself drawn towards the stone. The reason why the stone does
not move any more 1owards the iron is that the iron does not contain so
much void.
After all that, the only objection left to the (one imagines) rather
<p>breathless but persevering commentator            is that, if the attraction is
caused by similarity of atoms, the atoms of chaff and other things
attracted by amber must be similar to thase of the amber and of each
other. Why then do they not attract each other?</p>

</p>
    The general impression gained from our scrappy information about
<p>the atomists” account of cosmology and natural phenomena is that they
were highly conservative and entirely in the Ionian tradition, though
 Democritus       took some     pains to ensure that his explanations were
consistent with the general atomic theory, and in doing so produced a
few original ideas. Leucippus placed the sun beyond the fixed stars:
so had Anaximander. Anaximander had said long before Democritus
that the sea was contracting and would one day dry up. To Anaximenes
Democtitus owed his explanation of earthquakes and (through Anaxa-
 goras) the belief that the earth floated on 2 cushion of air. The ignition

of the stars by their rapid motion was Anaxagorean and did not fit very
easily into Leucippus’s cosmogony; so were Democritus’s ideas of
valleys in the moon and of the Milky Way and comets.
Equally marked is the absence of all trace of earlier or contemporary
<p>Pythagorean or related Greek notions. The contrast is seen particularly
in the attitude to the heavenly bodies, divine for Pythagoras, Alcmaeon
and their like, but for Xenophanes ignited clouds, ephemeral and at no
great distance from the earth, for Anaxagoras and Democritus lifeless
lumps of matter carried round passively by the universal vortex and
rendered incandescent by the speed of their revolution.                    Roth schools
of thought defended their belief with rational arguments. Why were
the motions of sun, moon and planets different from those of the fixed
stars? Democritus offered an explanation based entirely on the mech-
anical action of the vortex (pp. 420 f. above): for the Pythagoreans the
aberrations seemed evidence of an independent motion, and to any
Greek the idea of independent motion was inseparable from that of
life.

<p>An atomic theory of time as a series of discrete instants was evidently
current when Zeno wrote, since he took such pains to refute it; and
it has been plausibly connected with the Pythagoreans. It is strange
thar Democritus, the first to work out an atomic theory in comprehen-
sive detail, should not have produced counter-arguments to Zeno’s,
yet there is no evidence that he did. The aromists, says Alfieri,<em>
attempted no mathematical or philosophical analysis of either time or
motion, such as would have epabled them to stand up 1o Zeno’s thesis
that if time was discontinuous motion was impossible. This is probably
true. They may have believed that uaits of time, as of hady, existed
below the threshold of sensation, but if so they relied for proof simply
on experience, the ‘bastard” knowledge which points the way to the
“legitimate’. This will be true if Democritus’s theory of vision was
basically the same as that mentioned by Aristotle in De sensu, 440220
(pp- 444 £. below) and denied by him at 448a24.2 In general Aristotle’s

<p>                       The Aromists of the Fifth Century
own arguments against the conception of time as made up of atomic
‘nows’ suggest that it survived Zeno’s criticism and was still seriously
maintained, though he does not say by whom.?                         None of our evidence
is sealed with the name of Leucippus or Democritus, and we must
leave it an open question whether they ever said in so many words that
time was made up of atomic instants.? Yet if they failed to make this
point clear, and brought no mathematical arguments to bear on it, in
another direction they must be given credit for a considerable achieve-
ment in originality and independence of thought. With the exception
of the Eleatics who denied the reality of the temporal altogether, the
prevailing view of time before Leucippus was cyclical.                            It might be
more or less conscious and more or less strict, butin one form or another
it is a view which goes back to the most primitive modes of thought,
being based on elementary observation and crystallized in magical and
religious practices.        Starting from the annual recurrence of the seasons,
it extended to the ‘Great Year’ based on astronomical data and some-
titnes connected with natural catastrophes like the flood (vol. 1,458, n. 4).
Among the lonians a cyclical conception is indicated by the sole extant
fragment of Anaximander. The Pythagoreans believed in a strict repeti-
tion of history. The cyclical rise and fall of civilizations, marked by
natural disasters falling short of the complete dissolution of the world,
was probably taught by Xenophanes and reappears after the atomists in
Plato and Aristotle.           A cyclic scheme involving periodic destruction
and rebirth of the cosmos appears in Empedocles and later in Stoicism.3
The circle of time turns up in non-philosophical literature too, reflect-

motion on any hypothesis.

<p>It may also seem probable, if not inevitable, @ priori. But a different view is possible, as
Sirato showed by maintaining that time was composed of indivisible parts bur master and
space were nfineely divisible (fr. 82 Wehely, Sext. Mazh, ta.155), and Sexws menuons
Epicurus alone, though his name was commonly and lightly coupled with that of Demoeritus
by commentators.
3 Vol. 1, 76, 2811, 352, 1881, 452, 458. There is no evidence that Anaxagoras gave much
<p>consideration to the character of time. He believed motion to have started at a given moment
after an indefinite period of immobulity.   If he expressed this in anytung like the terms n which
Atistotle reports it (wévraw fpeuoluTiov Tév &amp;mepov xpdvov, p. 296 with n. 1 above), this sug-
gests that he had thought little about 1t. The notion of time divorced from any kind of motion is

ing in fact the current mode of thought.® In face of all this it is remark-
able to find in Leucippus and Democritus a conception of the infinity of
time with no trace of cyclical return in any form.? Worlds come into
being and pass away, but there is no repetition of skis world. As the
infinite millions of atoms jostle in infinite space through infinite time,
all sorts of formations will occur.               Some may even be identical, but if
that happens it is purely by chance (68 A 40 and 81, pp. 405 f., 406 1. 1).
This has wider implications. In Greek thought the notions of circular
motion and rational activity were intimately connected (vol. 1, 3531,
356), and in Plato’s Timaeus the circular paths of the heavenly bodies
were permanent and essential to their nature as the creations of a
superior intelligence. In Democritus they are purely accidental and
temporary. The sun and stars will disintegrate, and their constituent
atoms may be pushed into quite different paths. The dethronement of
the cyclical conception of time went with the banishment of reason
from the making of the world. It corresponds to the infinite irregularity
of atomic shapes which Plato’s creator-god reduced to limit and order
in the form of the regular geometrical solids.
If Democritus did not trouble to argue about the nature of time, this
<p>may have been because of its unreality. Sextus says: ‘ There appears
also to be ascribed to the natural philosophers who follow Democritus
and Epicurus some such conception of time as this: “Time is an
appearance resembling day and night.””’3 Caution is enjoined by the
extreme vagueness of the reference, but the doctrine seems to be that
of Epicurus that time is ‘an accident of accidents’, i.e. something that
we associate not with concrete things themselves but with their actions
and sufferings, under which he includes days and nights as well as
feelings, movements and states of rest.# If Sextus is right in saying that
this, like so much of Epicurus, originated with Democritus, then time
for him, so far from being a reality like atoms and void, was not even

and darkness, which we call day and night, are themselves ‘accidents’
of earth, sky, sun, moon and so forth, and time is only a peculiar kind
of accident of them,? of which we are aware by some kind of im-
mediate intuition. It should also be noticed however that if Demo-
critus made this remark of time in general, it could only have been as
an analogy, for he believed that time had never had a beginning3
whereas this world with its rising and setting sun has not always
existed. For Plato time was the motion of the heavenly bodies and had
no existence before them,* since he would only apply the' term to a
succession that was regular and ordered. This had no meaning in the
mindless universe of Democritus, and the definition ‘a day-like and
night-like appearance’ sounds suspiciously Platonic.                          If Democritus

<p>The atomists were least of all likely to depart from the consensus of
their period       that soul (psyche,         that which        distinguished      living fro;x
lifeless) was a tenuous form of material substance. In their system both
soul and fire (or heat) consisted of especially small, round atoms, and
Aristotle repularly says that Leucippus and Democritus actually
identified all three. Typical is De an. 403b31: ‘Democritus says the
soul is fire, and hot, for of the infinite shapes and atoms existing he says
the spherical are fire and soul.. . .Similarly Leucippus....The round
ones are soul, because shapess of this kind are best able to slip through
anything and to move other things by their own movement.” He com-

<p>                           The Narure of Soul
pares Democritus to Daedalus as he was described in 2 comedy, making
woaden images of Aphrodite move by pouring quicksilver into them
(406b15); ‘for he says it is the nature of the atomic spheres never to be
at rest and by their movement to draw the whole body into motion
with them.” Thus Democritus belongs for Aristotle to that school which
thought of motion as the primary characteristic of life (403b28). The
connexion with heat is brought out again in De respiratione (47223)1
‘He says the soul and the hot are the same, namely the primary forms
of spherical particles.” We remember too that, again according to
Atistotle, fire was singled out from the other elements by Leucippus
and Democtitus as consisting of spherical atoms (De caelo, 303214,
p- 414 above). Later, in Diogenes (9. 44), we are told that for Demo-
crimus soul was made of the same smooth, round atoms as the sun and
moon.
Did Democritus actually identify soul with fire? The guestion is
<p>not altogether simple. One is inclined to say that, on atomic principles,
a single atom, whether spherical or otherwise, could not be either, for
the atoms are without qualities (p. 393, n. 4 above). Aristotle has in~
ferred the identity from the fact that both are composed of atoms of the
same shape, but as Cherniss pointed out (4CP, 389, n. 3), ‘a single
spherical atom is neither fire nor soul: the specific characteristics of both
of theseas of all complex bodies were considered to be merely epipheno-~
mena of the combination of atoms’. Aétius retains the relationship to fire,
but says that soul is ‘ a fire-like compound of atoms spherical in shape and
having the potency of fire’ (4.3.5, A102).          Of the atoms of which fire
is composed he says, not that they are fire, but that they produce it.!
Amplifying the absence of sensible qualities in the atoms, Galen speci-
fies that they grow neither hot nor cold (D¢ elem. sec. Hipp. 1.2, 68
£49). (To Aristotle this may have seemed a little absurd, just as
Theophrastus in De sensu, 69, said it was unreasonable to make sense-
data at the same time affections of the senses and due to atomic shapes,
because shape is something absolute whereas sense-data are relative to
the perceiver.) Moreover the character of the compound is not deter-
mined by shape of atoms alone, but also by size and arrangement. The
atoms of sweet-tasting substances also were round, but ‘nat very small”

Yet although the atomic theory may not have demanded that two
<p>things composed of spherical atoms should have the same character, all
previous and contemporary thought would influence Democritus to-
wards associating life with heat,? and all authorities agree that he did so.
For thought to take place, the soul must be rightly tempered; and this
means that if we become 00 koz or too cold, the mind wanders                         (Theophr.
Sens. §8). Fire ( =‘the hot’) is not all visible as a glow or flame. The
invisible kind has atoms smaller than those of visible fire, as one may
see from Ther -hr. Sens. 75, where the colour red is said to ‘consist of
atoms like those of heat but larger: ‘compounds of larger atoms are
redder, as the flame and charcoal of green wood compared with that of
dry.’3 Soul, or vital heat, one may assume, has the finest texture and
smallest atoms of all, being neither visible nor even perceptible as heat

 Even the point that a single atom, whatever its shape, cannot have
<p>the qualities of soul—which might seem to be demanded by the general
atomic theory—is rendered doubtful when we go on to consider the
distribution of soul-atoms in the body. They are dispersed throughout
it in such a way that single atoms of soul and body alternate. By this
device Democritus thought that the soul could best carry out its
primary function of imparting motive power, and it means that, so far
as it discharges that function, there are no aggregates of soul-atoms
anywhere. This does not, however, constitute a breach in the monism
of atomic theory by ascribing ‘ qualities’, i.e. sensible qualities, to single

atoms.? All atoms are naturally, and if left to themselves, in motion.
In the cosmic vortex the larger and heavier of them, and those whose
shape makes them liable to entanglement, interfere with each other and
their motion is retarded or stopped. Smooth round atoms are least
liable to entanglement or clogging, the less so the smaller they are.
They can become entrapped in the larger conglomerations, but con-~
tinue to move freely within them and by this means impart their motion
to the others, making of the body as a whole a self-moving (i.e. living)
creature. No properties are involved other than the shape, size and
arrangement which are basic to all atomic theory. There is some
element of absurdity in this audacious attempt to explain the pheno-
mena of life on such simple materialistic and mechanistic principles,
and Aristotle’s jibe about the guicksilver is not unjustified; but so far
it is perfectly consistent.
The mind, or thinking portion of the soul, is an exception to the
<p>general rule that soul-atoms alternate with body-atoms throughout the
body. The evidence s Jate and conflicting, but leaves little room for
doubt. The Placita in contiguous sections (a) link Democritus with
Epicurus as holding that <em> the soul has two pasts, that which has reason
being situated in the heart while the unreasoning part is dispersed
chroughout the whole hady’, and (6) say that though Epicurus placed
it in the heart, Democritus like Plato put it in the head.?
 These reports agree that the mind is a concentration of soul in a
<p>particular part of the body, and there is no evidence of any weight to
set against them.3 We may take it that this location is in the head, as it

was for Alcmaeon, Anaxagoras and Diogenes of Apollonia, and later
for Plato.       For Epicurus it was the heart, and the testimony which
links the earlier atomist with the later is more likely to be from an
Epicurean source, and incorrect, than the one which distinguishes
between them.!
The atomic explanation of the mechanism of life and the cause of
<p>death has been preserved by Aristotle. Leucippus and Democritus
taught that life is maintained in our bodies by breathing. The tiny,
mobile soul-atoms are under constant pressure from the atmosphere
outside, which extrudes them from the body, just as the smaller and
smoother atoms were squeezed out by the larger in the formation of the
universe. But the air itself contains ‘many of those particles which
Democritus calls mind and soul. Hence, when we breathe and the air
enters, these enter along with it, and render the pressure ineffective,
thus preventing the dispersal of the soul within the animal.” ‘Death
occurs when the pressure from the environment gets the upper hand,
and the animal being unable to respire, the air from outside can no
longer enter and counteract it. Death is the outflow of soul-atoms from
the body owing to pressure from the environment.” In a milder and
reparable form the preponderance of outflow over inflow induces
sleep.?
Itis obvious that for Democritus, as later for Epicurus, the individual
<p>soul is dispersed at death, and its component particles scattered through-
out the universe: ‘ Democritus and Epicurus say that the soul is mortal,
and perishes along with the body.” Consequently no man need make
himself miserable by fears of torments and punishments after death—

evangelical fervour.? Nevertheless, Democritus taught that this did not
happen all at once, just as the body does not immediately disintegrate.
Indeed he is said to have maintained that the precise moment of death
is difficult to determine. The following passages are relevant:
(@) Alex. Aphrod. Top. 21.21 (68 A 117; the same in Aét. 4.9.20): Dead
<p>bodies have sensation, so Democritus thought,
 (8) Aét. 4.4.7 (Ax17): Democritus says that all things share in some
<p>sort of soul, even dead bodies, because they plainly retain some portion of
warmth and sensitivity when most of it has been breathed out.
(c) Tertullian, De an. 51 (a160): Democritus draws attention to the
<p>growth of nails and hair for a certain time in the tomb,
(d) Celsus, 2.6 (4160): Democritus, so far from allowing that there were
<p>any certain symptoms of approaching death, declared that there were no
completely certain indications by which medical men could satisfy them-
selves of the actual cessation of life.
With the cessation of breathing, then, most of the soul-atoms are
expelled from the body and dispersed, but since life and warmih are
closely associated (or even identified) and the body only gradually -
grows cold, and from certain other observations, Democritus con-
cluded that some vital funcrions, including even a minimum of sensa-
tion, were temporarily prolonged by a few remaining soul-atoms.?

to be genuine as most of that collection, at least in content. Since it contains what would be the
first known occurrence of both ouvelbnois and wuemdacrsiv—the larter dubbed by Rohde ‘a
lare monstrosity’—it is probably not verbally accurate. It runs: <em>Some men, not understanding
the corruption of our mortal nature, and conscious of their own wicked deeds, drag out their
lives in fear and confusion of mind, imagining lying myths ahout the time after death.”

</em> It will be remembered that Parmenides 100 taught that corpses retained a certain sensitive-
ness (p. 67 ahove). Whether the whvra in Aét. 4.4.7 means literally everything, including the
inanimate world, is perhaps doubtful in view of the words ‘even dead hodies’ which follow,
Probably however Democritus did believe that there was some smali measure of soul in every-
thing. Not only would he be following Empedacies (fr. 110.f0, p. 233 above} and (f Theo~
phrastus is to be trusted here) Parmenides-—which would accord with his general conservatism-—
but it would agree well with hus general theories if the tiniest and most mobile of all atoms should
find thewr way everywhere. We know already that the atmosphere contains them.
Mention should perhaps be made of Cicero, Tuse. 1.34.82: *Fac enim sic animum incerire ut
<p>corpus: num igitur aliquis dolor, aut omano post mortem sensus 1n corpore est? Nemo id
quidem dicit, etsi Democntum insimular Epicurus: Democritii negant.’        The speaker is counter-
ing the objection that the Epicurean denial of immonality robs us of the hope of future happiness,
Since all consciousness ends with death, the lass will not worry us. The most probabls interpreta-
tion of the passage quated is that Epicurus (always ready o belmle his predecessors in the atomic
theory) smusrepresented Democritus’s scientific caution as allowing a loophole for immontality.
Contemporary Democrizi would ratrally rebut such a charge.</p>

<p>                      The Aromists of the Fifth Century
In the collections of ethical sayings attributed to Democritus the
<p>psyche appears as paturally superior to, and in control of, the body,
which is called its tent, hut or tabernacle (oxfivos, the word which
survived to represent a very different relationship between soul and
body in the New Testament).* The soul deserves the higher considera-
tion, for its perfection can correct bodily defects but nat vice versa,
and its goods are ‘more divine’ than bodily goods; in its domain lie
happiness and unhappiness, and so forth. This must be considered in
another context, together with the question of the authenticity of the
ethical fragments. Despite the soul’s superior dignity, Zeller was right
to emphasize that nothing is said about it to contradict the out‘and-out
materialism of the atomists.? Cicero twice speaks of the ‘concursio
forwita® of atoms that goes to produce soul and mind in Democritus.</p>
</p>
           Addirional note: Democritus &lt; On the Next World’®
<p>A work of this name (wepi 7&amp;v &amp;v “AiBov) is listed among the ethical
(not physical) writings of Democritus in the catalogue of Thrasyllus.
Athenaeus (168, DK, fr. o c), telling the story of how Democritus
escaped prosecution by reading his own writings, says that the writings
in question were this one and the Great World-System, though Dio-
genes (9.39) mentions only the latter in this connexion. Proclus
(In Remp. 2. 113 Kroll, DK, fr. 1) again cites the work (with the slight
variation Trepi ToU “AiSov in the title) as authority for giving credit to
stories of the resuscitation of the apparently dead. ‘Death’, he says,
‘is not, it seems, according to this book the extinction of all life what-
soever in the body. It is weakened, perhaps, by some blow or wound,
but the bonds of the soul remain rooted in the marrow and the heart
retains the spark of life buried in the depths. So long as these remain,
the body is fit for animation and recovers the life that has been
quenched.” Proclus is commenting on the myth of Er in the tenth book
of Plato’s Republic.         Demacritus, he says, ‘like many other writers of</p>

antiquity’, has collected stories of such resuscitations, and this is his
explanation of them, It is a rational explanation fully in keeping with
what we have just seen of his theories about death, and Proclus’s words
do much to allay suspicions which may arise from the fact that works
with the same title are ascribed by Diogenes (9.55 and §.87) to
Democritus’s older contemporary Protagoras and to Heraclides
Ponticus. Stories of miraculous resuscitations were told of a number of
semi-mythical figures, notably Abaris, Epimenides and Hermotimus
(the stock examples, mentioned      here by Proclus). That      of Abaris
appears in Herodotus, Epimenides was well known to both Plato and
Aristotle and so no doubt was Hermotimus also, though Aristotle is
the first to mention him. These facts must be set against the argument
of M. Wellmann that the passage comes from Bolus (p. 388, n. 1
above) and belongs to an alleged ‘dvapicsos-literature’ initiated by
Heraclides, Chrysippus and others. Wellmann’s arguments are sum-
marized by Alfieri (4romisii, 180, 1. 461), who is convinced by them and
adds others which seem no more compelling, e.g. that there are traces
of Pythagorean language and no mention of atoms. Of other scholars
one may mention that Rohide (Psyche, 408,n. 103) thought it </em> difficult 10
be certain that Democritus was the author of the work’, but Wilamowitz
(Glaube, 1. 304, n. 1) assumed its authenticity and Schmid (Gesch. gr.
Lit. 1.5.2.2, 248, n. 7) thought the doubts of Wellmann unjustified.
Inview ofstorieslike those of Aristeas (Hdt. 4. 14) and Er the Armenian
<p>(for Plato was clearly not the first to tell such a tale), one must accept
the fact that ‘Gvapicsots-literatute’ has a Jong history, and that a work
in the course of which Democritus is reported to have investigated
its scientific credentials is very likely to have been genuine. The
general purport of the work was no doubt to disprove the possibility
of the soul living on in another world after the dissolution of the
body, and in all probability fr. 297 (p. 435, n. 1 above) came from the
same source. On the other hand in the particular passage which we
have been considering Proclus makes no claim to be giving a literal
quotation, and some of the language, and even other details (e.g.
the prominence of marrow and heart), may be un-Democritean.
All one can take from it is that Democritus upheld the credibility of
staries about recovery from apparent death by reference to his theory

 that the body is not robbed of every spark of life at the moment of
death, and indeed that the ‘moment of death’ is not determinable with
certainty.
                                     (11) Sensation
<p>The atomists’ theories of sensation are attributed either jointly to
Leucippus and Democritus or to Democritus alone. From the long and
elaborate account which Theophrastus gives of the views of Demo-
critus, we may conclude that he added a great deal of detail to a com-
paratively simple outline provided by Leucippus. In general,'sensation
is the result of an alteration in our own bodies, or parts of them, caused
by the impact of atoms from without. Sensible qualities are <em>affections
of the sensitive part undergoing alteration, from which comes the
perception: not even cold and heat have an objective character, but the
atom as it moves brings about an alteration in us also’.</em> Every act of
sensation must involve actual physical contact, so that all sensation
becomes a form of touch, as Aristotle noted and Lucretius later pro-
claimed with an emotional insistence:
                 Tactus enim, tactus, pro divom numina sancta,
                 corporis est sensus.*
</p>
</p>
</p>
</p>
<p>As evidence that sensations are not solely déetermined by the atomic
composition of the sensa, but by an interaction of this with the body
of the perceiving subject, Democritus adduced the relativity of sensa-
tions: what is sweet to one is bitter to another, and so on (63).3 ‘ The
perceiving subjects alter in composition according to their condition
and age, whence it is clear that their physical state is a cause of their
sense-impressions’ (64). After explaining that every sensible object
contains atoms of many different shapes but takes its character from
those that preponderate, Theophrastus continues: ‘it depends also on

the condition of the body which they enter; this too makes no little
difference, because the same object can sometimes produce contrary
effects and contrasting objects the same effect’ (67).
Theophrastus claims to see a glaring contradiction in a theory which
<p>calls sensations affections of the sense-organ and at the same time
accounts for them by atomic shape, so that heat for example is said to
have no ‘nature’ of its own but to be a purely relative and subjective
impression, and yet one can speak of the “shapes’ of heat as spherical
(68 and 69: this is ‘the greatest inconsistency and affects all instances
alike”). There does not seem any inconsistency in supposing that the
effect on a subject of atoms of a certain shape varies according to the
state of the atoms in the subject itself; yet since Democritus apparently
committed himself to definite statements like ‘sweet flavour consists of
round atoms’, one wonders whether, when the same substance tastes
sweet to one and bitter to another, it is round atoms that are actually the
cause of bitterness. Whetheror not Democritus was expliciton the point,<em>
the explanation in his mind was probably that every physical substance
contains atoms of many different shapes and takes its sensible qualities
from those which predominate. This he did say (67), so that honey, for
instance, whose larger and smooth-surfaced atoms entering our bodies
produce sweet taste, also contains rough and smaller ones which produce
bitter. Which of these objective factors becomes effective would then
depend on the state of the passages (poroi) in the perceiver’s body. There
is some evidence that Democritus, like Empedocles, in his theory of
sensation made use of poroi which mustbe of the right size for the sensato
fit them.”
? There seem to have heen gaps in his exposition. Even in the case of a bitter juice ruming
<p>sweet, where an explanation on atomic lines is easy, Theophrastus has 1o choose berween the
possibilities himsel{ because he has not found one in Democnitus (CP, 6.7.2, A132).       On the
question of relativityit mayjust possiblybe significantthatatoms causing bitterness and sweetness
are smd 10 be basically of the same shape: the former too are smooth and round, but small, and
with </p>
</em>curvatures” (kauwred) on the surface which make their compound sticky (66). They are not
sharp and angular like those producing astringency (e1pugvév), so might perhaps taste sweet to
an unusually constituted tongue. This of course is sheer guesswork.
* A suspiciously comprehensive catalogue in Aétius (4.9.6, DK 28 &amp; 47) lists hir along with
<p>Parmenides, Anaxagoras and Heraclides as well as Emgedocles and Epicwrus as giving this

critus’s theory of dreams. Cf, the mention of Democritus and mépot by the comic poet Damo-

<p>                       The Atomists of the Fifth Century
There is perhaps more substance in anather of Theophrastus’s eriti-
<p>cisms, that it was unreasonable to assign objective existence not only to
shape and size, which are primary because properties of single atoms, buc
also to weight and lightness, hardness and sofiness,in compoundbodies.<em>
These Democritus explained as dependent on the proportion of atoms
to empty space in the perceived body. Light, and also soft or yielding,
bodies contain more void; heavy, and hard or resistant, more solid.?
The general theory may be summed up in the saying of Demacritus
<p>which was often quoted, most fully by Sextus: ‘In our beliefithere are
sweet and bitter, hot and cold, in our belief there is colour; but in truth
there are atoms and void.” To this Sextus adds another direct quotation:
“In reality we grasp nothing precisely, but as it shifts according to the
disposition both of our body and of the things that enter into and press
upon it} Simplicius was no doubt right in seeing a reference
to Demoacritus when Aristotle attributes to ‘earlier scientists’ the
Berkeleian-sounding view that ‘there is no black or white without
sight, nor flavour without tasting’.4
 t ¢8,71. Within the cosmic whirl single atoms themselves differ in weight, which, since they
<p>contain no void, depends directly on their size. Ia this connexion weight 1s simply a greater or
lesser tendency to move in a particular direction. Symilarly the hardness and softness of com-
pounds may be descnbed only in terms of capacity to resist pressure, But of Theophrastus is
right, when spealung of compounds Democritus treated all these as sensible properties (edodnd,
63): things “feel heavy® or ‘feel soft’. (Baeumker goes mto this question in considerable detail
in Probl. d. Materie, 92, n. 5, 93£.)

</p>
</p>
</em> He did not overlook the fact that a soft substance (2., lead) may be heavier than a harder
one (iron), butexplained this as a matter of posinon and grouping of yhe internal spaces (62). Lead
contains a greater total of solid than an equal volume of iron, but has sohd and void evenly
distributed throughaout: the hardness of the iron is due ta its having patches of greater density
oceurring irregularly among larger spaces. See further on this Sambursky, Phys. World, 120f.,
who discusses the matter in modern terms of solid state and latrice-structure, and von Fritz,

<p>                                 Theory of Sensation
  Individual sensations and their objects. For our knowledge of whar
Democritus wrote on these topics we depend almost wholly on
Theophrastus,        from     whom       we    learn     that he only     gave   a partial
account: of the senses he had his own views on sight and hearing, but
‘treats    the rest much         as most other thinkers have done’ (57); and
whereas he explained all objects of sense by their atoms, ‘he does not
recount the shapes of all of them, but concentrates on flavours and
colours’ (64).
All sensation is the result of physical contact, yet this does not seem
<p>1o bave given any universal primacy or anthority to the sense of touch
itself. It is consigned, along with the other senses, to the realm of
“bastard knowledge’ in fr. 11." We have seen some examples of tactual
sensations, and a little more may be added on that of warmth, Theo-
phrastus     associates      the atomism            of Democritus      with   that of the
Pythagoreans as maintaining that ‘bodies which separate and divide
give the sensation of warmth, whereas those that draw together and
condense give the sensation of cold’. Again, after saying that rough
and angular atoms cause sour tastes by their power of ‘drawing to-
gether and conrracting’, he adds: ‘wherefore sourness also heats the
body, by creating empty spaces within it; for that grows hottest which
contains most void.”<em> This is the familiar connexion of hear with
expansion and cold with contraction, established by Anaximenes and
here transmuted into atomic terms. In these terms, however, it means
that the rough and angular atoms bring about indirectly the same result
as the tiny spherical fire-producing atoms achieve by their smallness
and rapid motion. This was noted by Hammer-Jensen, who also draws
attention to a passage in Aristotle in which Democritus is said to have
explained the freezing of liquids by the position and arrangement of
the atoms, and concludes that the atomists were the first Greeks to
distinguish heat from fire.3
 Vision and colour. The atomic theory of vision is reported inasimpler
<p>and a more complex form. In the former it is attributed to Leucippus
and Democritus together, in the latter to Democritus alone. It looks

therefore as if here too Democritus had elaborated a theory of Leucip-
pus, and in a way which raises serious difficulties.
In its first form the theory takes over the Empedoclean doctrine of
<p>effluences, with the eye performing a purely receptive role.              External
objects are constantly giving off films of atoms which retain the
approximate form of their surfaces and so constitute ‘images’ of them.
These actually enter the eye, where they appear as the reflexion of the
object, and stimulate the sensation. The laconic expression of Aristotle
(De sens. 438a6) that <em> Democritus thinks sight is the reflexion’ is thus
expanded by his commentator Alexander (p. 24.14, 67 A 29):
Democritus says that to see means to receive the reflexion from            what is
seen. The reflexion 1s the shape which appears in the pupil, just as it does
also in any other bright things which are capable of retaining a reflexion.
He believed (like Leucippus before him and the Epicureans after) in certain
images emanating from things and similar in shape to the things from which
they emanate (i.e. the objects of vision), which enter the eyes of the beholder,
and that this is how vision occurs.
Similarly, Theophrastus begins his account with the words (§ 50) : Vision
he explains by the reflexion’, and in 80 observes: ‘He says that our
seeing is due to the effluence and to the reflexion falling upon the eye.’
This at least has the merit of simplicity, and upholds the requirement
<p>of atornic materialism that all sensation, like every other form of action,
must involve direct physical contact, In the transit of the images
through the air it also allows for the possibility of distortion and hence
of errors in identification. Aristotle’s criticism, that if sight involves
nothing further than reflexion all reflecting surfaces ought to see, is
only pertinent from the point of view of a more advanced period of
thought when the difficulties of any purely materialistic explanation of
psychical phenomena were beoming apparent.’ The theory did indeed
lead to difficulties. There was the question how two people could see
each other without their ‘images’ colliding, though the atomists may
have thought that these were tenuous enough, and with sufficient
interstices of void, to pass through one another; and there seems to be
no explanation of how the effluences from an elephant shrink sufficiently
to enter the eye as a miniature picture of him,

<p>                                   Theory of Vision
It may have been this sort of consideration that led Democritus to
<p>introduce an ingenious complication into the theory, about which one
is tempted to echo the words of Theophrastus (55) that ‘in trying to
say something original about vision he has left the problem even farther
from solution’. As Theophrastus explains it (50), the reflexion, that is,
the image of the object seen, is not formed directly in the eye. There are
effluences from everything, including the eye itselfT and those from
eye and object meet somewhere in the air between them, compress and
even solidify it, and stamp on it the image of the object ‘as if moulded
in wax’ (a phrase which Theophrastus claims to be taking from
Democritus himself). This image? enters and shows up in the eyes,
being described as solid in contrast to their moist consistency. There
follow some details of the sort of eyes which are best adapted to receive
the images and so enjoy the clearest vision: they must be moist and
spongy rather than hard, and in particular must have ‘ducts’ (pAéBes,
lit. “veins”) that are straight and of a formation corresponding to that
of the impressions, as the Empedoclean and atomic theories demanded.
To explain why we see by day and not in the dark, Democritus felt
compelled to suppose that the sun drives air away from itself and in
so doing condenses it, thus making it more capable of receiving and
retaining an impression. The actual sensation of sight (Theophrastus
informs us) is a function not only of the eyes bus of the whole body
(that is, presumably, of the soul-atoms in it), to which the eyes trans-
mit’ the image or reflexion.
An isolated assertion of Democritus, that ‘if the space between
<p>were void, one could even see clearly an ant on the vault of the sky’,
does nothing to decrease our bewilderment about these strange theories.
Aristotle, who quotes it, criticizes it on the ground that sight requires a
medium; but that is precisely what Democritus believed, indeed his
medium, air, was something which filled space even more obviously
than Aristotle’s, which was light. If Democritus really said this, he</p>

Empedocles’s theory of fire streaming from the eye may have been one of the motives for intro-
ducing the complication.
  </em> Aristotle and Theophrastus use the familiar word si5whov, but according to the Etym. Gen.
(Dem, fr. 123) Democtitus had his own special term BeixeAov, perhaps to distinguish these
imprints from films coming directly from the objects,</p>

<p>                      The Aromists of the Fifth Century
must have been using the word ‘void’ for once in a loose sense to
mean void of anything non-transparent to obstruct the view.!
1f we had Democrits’s own writings on vision, they might have
<p>enlightened us on many points. Seen through the unsympathetic eyes
of Theophrastus, the theories contain absurdities which there is little
point in trying to remove by guesswork. How, asks Theophrastus,
can so unstable a substance as air have permanent impressions stamped
on it? Why are they necessary in any case, when we are already pro-
vided with emanations which convey the object’s form? What is meant
by the sun’s condensing the air? Its normal effect is to disperse it.
Why do we not see ourselves, and, in general, how do all the thousands
of imprints in the air avoid crossing each other’s paths and interfering
with each other? And so forth. If Democritus had answers to all
these queries, we do not know what they were. One point of interest
may be added.? There is evidence, mainly from Alexander’s commen-
taries on Aristotle, that just as a single atom is below the level of percep-
tion, so also is a single film or ‘image’, which is probably only one
atom thick. The films are, however, thrown off from their objects in
rapid succession, and they (or the air bearing their imprints), entering
the eye without interruption, give an effect of continuity. Otherwise
there would be no continuity in sensation or unity in the object per-
ceived, any more than in an object whose individual atoms could be
perceived singly.         It follows that there is not only a threshold of size</p>
</p>
? Arist, De an. 419a15. Mugler (Rey. de Philol. 1959, 22, n. 3) suggests that the remark was
<p>intended to anticipate criticism such as that of Alexander (De sensu, 28.18 and De an., scr. min.
138.20) that the continnous giving-off of films of atomsby
                                                      the abjects of sight must in time have
<p>reduced them to nothing, especially considering that we see things as far distant as stars in the
sky. (This objection was also put forward by Gomperz, Gr. Th. 1.358.) The quantitative dis-
proportion between a visible body and the sibwha it emits {says Mugler) is so great that even
something s0 small as an ant contains enough substance to send out, without endangering its
consistence, material images across the whole distance between earth and stars. This is conjectural,
and in fact Zeller took a contrary view (ZN, 1127, . 1)+ the possibihiry of seeing an ant in heaven,
he says, explains why Demoeritus said it was not the ei5wAa themselves that fall on the eye but
anly their imprint. IfI understand the paiat, he means that 1c was impossible for Demacritus o
caneeive of the actual films of atoms from the creature’s body performing the whole journey. In
the same note Mugler asserts (without argument or evidence) ‘Démocrite n’a jamais enseigné
I"émission, par l'ceil, de rayons visuels’. Thus is contrary to the evidence.
  * I owe the following observations 10 Mugler’s article in Rev. de Philol. 1959, pp. 23 1., where
the: passages from Alexander and others will be found. It is Democritus and Leucippus, rather
than Epicurus, whom Alexander has taken as authorities for the theory of visual effiuences,
though he mentions Epicurus as their follower (De sensu, pp. 24 and 56 Wendland).</p>

below which bodies are imperceptible, but also a lower limit of percep-
tion in time. Aristotle mentions the possibility of imperceptible time
in connexion with an atomic theory of colour in the De sensu.<em>
This brings us to colour, which we already know to be a purely
<p>“secondary’ and subjective quality. The sensation of colour is produced
in the soul by the shape and position of the atoms on the surface of
objects, and the amount of space between them. There are four primary
colours—white, black, red and yellow—and the others are combinations
of these. Atoms producing the effect of white are smooth on hard
surfaces, round on those that are loose and friable. These cast no
shadow and are easy to penetrate, thus giving the effect of brightness
and translucency. (Theophrastus complains that Democritus writes as
if he were talking of these qualities rather than of white colour.)</p>
</em>
Black results from rough and irregular atoms which cast shadows and
from poroi that are crooked and not easy to penetrate; red from atoms
¢ similar to those which produce heat but larger’. Concerning yellow
Theophrastus could find no mention of the shapes of atoms, but only
that it results from the solid and the void, being mixed of both, and
its colour varying according to the position and order of these con-
stituents’. It seems natural to suppose from what we are told that colour
vaties according to the ways in which the atoms, by their different
shapes and the different angles at which they lie to one another and to
the beholder, throw back, absorb or let through the light that falls upon
them.     Unfortunately the sources tell us nothing about Democritus’s
views on the nature and behaviour of light, which like everything else
must have been corporeal and atomic in structure. Aristotle contents
¥ 440a20, This is quoted by Mugler, who does not however add that the theory in question,
<p>though it offers anatomicexplanation of colour,is different fram that of Democritus as described
in detail by Theophrastus. The one which Aristotle is criticizing derives all other colours from
black and white, affirmung that they ace only an effect produced when these two are juxtaposed in
quantities so minute that exther separately 1s invisible. Each sends out emanations which reach
the eye 1 such rapid succession that they seem to arrive simultaneously, and give the effect of a
colour which is neither white nar black. Demacritus, however, taughe thar red and green are
equally primary with black and white. The primacy of black and white only was said by Theo-
phrastus (59, 79) to have been commonly accepted by earlier thinkers, and was recained with a
different explanation by Aristotle himself, bur Democtitus was an exception.        (Possibly also

The production of other colours by mixture of the primaries was
<p>described by Democritus in loving detail, some of which is reproduced
in Theophrastus.            One is inevitably reminded of the simile of the
painter’s palette in Empedocles, and whether or not Democritus was
drawing on experience of the actual mixing of pigments, he certainly
shows a gennine delight in the rich variety of colour.                       An example will
suffice (76):                                                                       !
Gold, bronze and all similar hues are composed of white and red: from the
white comes their brightness and from the red their ruddiness, for in com-
bination the red sinks into the empty interstices of the white. If to these be
added yellow,” it produces the most beautiful colonr, but the additions of
yellow must be small, for the white and red are so combined as not to allow
of a large admixmre. The tints will vary according to the amounts added.
Democritus gave similar descriptions of blue (woad), leck-green,
cyanus and nut-brown, adding that the number of colours which can
be produced by mixture is infinite.

colours which Democritus names as their components. This did notworry Plato (Zim. 68d), but
ought to have wortied Democritus, who could not, like Plato, shift the onus on to God| Kranz,

of the ear. In general terms this was the explanation of Alcmaeon,
Empedocles and Anaxagoras. Democritus added that of course this air
can enter the body at all points, but not through passages large enough
to make the sound perceptible. On the other hand, once the sound has
entered, the ear (like the eye in sight) acts only as a channel through
which it is dispensed all over the body. In both sight and hearing, we
perceive (as Plato later put it) not wizh but tArough the sense-organs:
the sensitive soul is ubiquitous in the body (p. 432 above).
Aétius, in an extract which is independent of Theophrastus and may
<p>come from Posidonius, describes the theory as more complex.                                      It is
best seen in the context of that of Epicurus which precedes it:</p>
</p>
</p>
</em>
Epicurus says that sound is a stream [sc. of atoms) emitted by whatever gives
tongue or produces a noise of any kind. This stream is shattered into particles
of similar shape, that is to say, round going with round and irregular and
triangular with their like. When these enter the ears they effect perception
of the sound. . ..Democritus says that the air also is shattered into particles
of similar shape and rolled along with the sound.
The rest of the passage consists of illustrations of the law that like is
drawn 1o like (p. 409 above), in justification of the segregation of
particles into groups of similars.
The two theories form a parallel to those of sight. In both cases
<p>Epicurus has rejected Democritus as over-subtle and adopted a simpler
view which perhaps goes back to Leucippus. For both of them sound,
like everything else, was a material body of particulate structure
(‘breath-like’ according to Epicurus);<em> but whereas Epicurus taught
that these sound-particles themselves, emitted by the sources of sound,
impinged on the ear of the hearer, Democritus added an intermediate
stage. The sound-particles first strike the intervening air and conform
it to their own likeness. Presumably then, as with sight, it is not the
actual effluence from the object, but an ‘image” of it ‘stamped upon’
the air, which enters the organ of the perceiver. Perhaps (we do not
know) the mortive of this awkward theory was to explain the diffusion

a hint in Anaxagoras, who in his explanation of sound distinguished
berween ‘breath’ and <em>air’ and spoke of the impact of the one upon the
other (p. 318, n. 3 above).           Empedocles took the simpler view, though
here as in general Demacritus followed him in supposing that sensation
could only take place through passages of the right size to fit the
appropriate effluences. Theophiasius concludes with a description of

Taste, flavours, odours.           In the discussion of flavours in his treatise
<p>De causis plantarum (6.1.21.), Theophrastus suggests that'there are
two main types of explanation, in terms of the effect on the sense-
organ and in terms of the intrinsic properties of the flavoured substance,
One may for instance describe what is sweet as penetrating the moisture
of the tongue, or as having a relaxing or smoothing effect, or say that
pungent things heat the tongue, astringent dry it and so forth. Alterna-
tively one may say that che particles of sweet substances are large and
round, those of astringent large, rough and polygonal, and so forth.
Democritus chose the latter way. In fact hawever the two ought not
to be separated, since the purpose of ascribing shapes to the particles can
oply be to explain how they come to have the sensible effects which they
do; and that being so, some account of the body acted upon is called
for as well as of the body acting, of the subject as well as the object of
taste. This applies particularly to the theory of Democritus, because he
held that the same object might produce the effect of different flavours
in different people.” Yet this side of the question, Theophrastus claims,
was neglected by Demoeritus in the case of taste (De sensu, 72).
The fullest description of the atomic shapes accounting for flavours
<p>and their effects is given by Theophrastus in De sensu, 65—7. They are
summarized thus in De causis plantarum (6.1.6, a120):
Democritus assigns a shape to each flavour. Sweetness is round and large;
astringency large, rough, polygonal, not rounded; sharp [sour] taste as its

pungency is round, small, with angles and bends; saltiness angular, large,
crooked, with equal sides; bitterness round and smooth but with irregularities
and small in size; oily flavour is fine, round and small.
In its details, this reduction of flavours to the effects of atomic shape
<p>becomes somewhat fantastic, yet it has had a long history. The French
chemist Lémery wrote in 1675:
The hidden nature of a thing cannot be better explained than by attributing
to its parts shapes corresponding to all the effects it produces. No one will
deny that the acidity of a liquid consists in pointed particles. All experience
counfirms this. You have only to taste it to feel a pricking of the tongue like
that caused by some material cut into very fine points.®
On odour and smelling we have only one sentence from Theo-
<p>phrastus, designed to exemplify how much Democritus left out (82):
He omitted to add any definition of odour except for this, that it is produced
by something subtle emanating from heavy substances.                      But he does not go
on to say what its nature is, or what is the agent, though that is perhaps the
oSt important point.</p>

<p>Section 4.10 of Aétius summarizes opinions on the number of the
senses: in Stoic belief there are five, in Aristotle five plus the ‘common
sense’, which however is not a sixth sense but a mode of joint operation
of the others. It continues:?
Democritus says there are more {i.e. more than five, as the context makes
clear] in irrational animals, in wise men, and in the gods.
Democritus says that there are more senses than objects of sense, but
<p>because the objects do not correspond in number [i.e. presumably to the
senses] they are not noticed.

I'see no difficulty in the first sentence. Observation of the instinctive

and it is equally natural to suppose that the gods possess senses lacking
to ordinary men. Scholars have been puzaled by the inclusion of </p>

men’, and Rohde was driven to the expedient of supposing that their
extra sense was to be identified with reason, the ‘genuine cognition’
which Democritus expressly contrasted with the ‘bastard cognition’
of the senses (p. 459 below). This is impossible, but the word used
(sophot) is one which included poets, prophets and religious teachers
and sometimes referred primarily to such figures.        These in common
belief were men who had direct access to superhuman sources of cogni-
tion, and it was sometimes suggested that to arrogate to 'oneself the
title of sophos was to lay claim to divine powers. There s the story that
Pythagoras would only call himself philo-sophos, lover of wisdom, for
‘1o one is wise save God’ (vol. I, 204); and in Plato’s Phaedrus (278d)
Sacrates repeats that the word ‘befits a god alone’. Now Democritus
believed that poets wrote ‘under divine inspiration and by a holy
spirit’ and that prophetic dreams, voices and visions were a reality
(frr. 17,18, 166, A77; see pp. 477, 432 below). Neither poets nor prophets
were thinking things out intellectually; they were undergoing a direct
experience, and the capacity to do so may well have appeared to Demo-
critus (or at least heen interpreted by his expositors) as an extra sense.
 The second sentence is obscure. I can find no certain explanation of
<p>ity and T suspect that the text may have got corrupted. Zeller, after
paraphrasing it ‘that many impressions arouse no sensation’, states
frankly in a footnote (ZN, 1129, n. 2) that to give it this sense ‘is pure
conjecture’. Diels connected it with Lucretius 4,802:
        quia tenuia sunt [sc. simulacral, nisi quae contendit acuta,
     cernere non potis est animus.

</p>
</p>
<p>It has been usual to translate odobficeis here (as the Lucretian parallel
demands) as ‘individual acts of sensation’ instead of ‘senses®, Thus
Mugler (R. de Philol. 1959, 35) says: ‘ Démocrite, d'aprés Aétius, con-
sidérait le nombre de sensations possibles comme supérienr 4 celui
des objets effectivement pergus.” According to him, the soul exercises
choice over what it will perceive and can ler other objects or ‘images’
slip by, otherwise the organism would be at the mercy of an excessive
number of stimulations from its environment. This, it seems to me,

<p>                       Note on the Number of the Senses
would require that alodnté should be more numerous than alafvger,
not vice versa. (The shift of meaning produced by the addition of
‘possibles’ and “effectivement’ is scarcely legitimate.) Apart from this,
the use of the word to mean a single act of sensation is rare,<em> and in the
context of Aét. 4.10 practically impossible. If the sentence reflects
anything that Democritus actually said, a possible meaning might be
that because (as the previous sentence has told us) some fiving creatures
have more than five senses, there must be more senses than there are
classes of the things commonly tecognized as sensibles (odant&amp;). These
are sights, sounds, flavours, odoursand tactile sensa. An extra sense will
have none of these as its object, hence there are more senses than odofné
in the ordinary sense of the word. This however cannot be said to be
certain, and the possibility remains that the sentence has suffered
damage and is inherently confused. For other opinions see Zeller and
Mugler, loce. cit. and Alfieri, Atomisti, 134, n. 337 (for A115) and 135,
n. 339 (for A116).
                            (12) Thought
<p>The materialism of Leucippus and Democritus allowed of no excep-
tions, Thought as well as sensation had to depend on a physical
mechanism. The report of Aétius is (4. 8. 5 and 10, 67 A 30):
Leucippus and Democritus say that sensations and thoughts (votioess) are
alterations of the body.
Leucippus, Democritus and Epicurus say that sensation and thought take
<p>place by the impact of images from outside. Neither occurs ta anyone with-
out the impact of an image.?
A more complex, and in parts obscure account is given by Theo-
<p>phrastus in De sensu (58):
Concerning thought (1o ¢povelv) Democritus said this much, thar it
occurs when the soul is in a balanced condition after the movement;3 but if

the subject is t0o hot or too cold, it is disturbed [or altered, peraAAdrraw].
Hence the ancients were right in thinking of it [i.e. mental derangement] as
‘being of altered mind’." It is evident then that he derives thought from the
composition of the body, which no doubt is only logical since he regards
soul as a form of body.
In Aristotle’s view, ‘soul and mind are the same’ for Democritus,
<p>and “truth is what appears’. This is true in so far as both sou} and mind
are material and of the same atomic composition, and sincq all reality
must have a physical form there are no objects of cognition which
Aristotle would elass as “intelligibles” (vonté). All forms of physical
existence are for him objects of sensation. So he says elsewhere that
Democritus is one of those who hold that thought is a form' of sensa-
tion, and sensation a physical alteration, and that therefore what appears
to the senses is necessarily true.?
Thought, then, is exactly parallel to sensation in that it results from
<p>a disturbance of the soul-atoms by atomic complexes from without;
and it varies according to the internal condition of the thinking subject.
For the Lest results the bodily ‘mixture’ (kp&amp;otg) must be ‘duly pro-
portioned” (oUpperpos). Remembering that the organ of thought is a
concentration of soul-atoms in a particular part of the body, one may
assume that it is capable of being stimulated by complexes that are too
suble to affect the sense-organs as they traverse their ‘passages’, or the
thinly spread soul-atoms elsewhere; for as Theophrastus puts it (63),
“what is massed together has a powerful effect, but what is widely</p>

<p>                               The Nature of Thought
diffused is imperceptible’. This point has been most clearly expressed
by Bailey (Azomists, 173):
Certain ‘idols’, then, which are too fine to stir the more distributed soul-
atoms on the surface of the body and in the organs of sense and so produce
sensation, pass on within the body until they reach the mind. There, as the
soul-atoms are so closely packed, the ‘idols’ cannot pass by without moving
them and the result of this motion is the peculiar kind of sensation which we
call thought:     it is in its nature enactly parallel to the movements which
produce sight or hearing.
This I believe is true, but probably not the whole truth.                         It suggests
complete independence, whereas thought is in some sense derived from
sensation ; it receives its data from the senses as Democritus said in what
is apparently a direct quotation (fr. 125). It looks therefore as if the
experience of sensation may so disturb the whole soul that its agitation
reaches the mind and can affect its capacity for thought. 1f the reading
is correct, this will be the meaning of the words “after the movement”
in the passage quoted from Theophrastus §8. Here however we touch
on the whole theory of knowledge, which had best be reserved for
separate treatment.
 Democritus’s explanation of thought reminds us of that of Parmen-
<p>ides in the Way of Seeming. He too said that the mind varied according
to the condition of the body, and in particular according to the pre-
valence of hot or cold, a close parallel to what Theophrastus says of
Democritus in §8. The same depeadence on changing physical con-
dition was emphasized by Empedacles.” These resemblances were
noticed by Aristotle, who summed up what was for him their common
philosophical failure in the words ( Metapk. 1010a1): <em> They sought the
truth about reality, but on the assumption that the only real things were
the sensibles.” For Aristotle, trained by Plato, reality was divided into
sensible (corporeal) and intelligible (incorporeal), and he put all his
predecessors an a level because they were incapable of recognizing this
distinetion.? The truth seems to be that all philosophers hitherto (with
the exception of the unique arguments of Parmenides in the Way of
ab’ Parm. fi. 16 and Theophr. Sens. 3; Emped. fir. 106 and 108. See pp- 67, 228 and 243

Truth) had given an explanation of knowledge in what to a more
sophisticated mind are materialistic terms, but only now that the
atomists havegone further in sharpening and making explicit the concept
of matetialism, have the problems of explaining intellection and know-
ledge in these terms become acute. Indeed they have come into sight
for the first time. By the uncompromising clarity of their materialism,
the atomists made it very difficult indeed for themselves to answer
questions about the relation between sensation and thought, or to meet
a jibe like that of Cicero, who asked whether, whenever he thought
about Britain, an ‘image’ had detached itself from that island to come
and hit him in the chest (4d fam. 15. 16. 2). Ttis not surprising if the
first serious attempt to reduce all intellectual activity to purely material
contact was not entirely successful. We may still admire its boldness
and consistency.
                               (13) Theory of knowledge
<p>Nowhere does one feel so keenly the loss of Democritus’s own writings
as in trying to discover what the atomists thought about how, and to
what extent, we can know the truth about the world around us, by
what means our minds can be put in contact with reality and compre-
hend its nature. For this we must rely on some quotations and com-
ments in Sextus and a few remarks in Aristotle, and these have been
thought by many to be flatly contradictory. Before considering them
directly, some preliminary points must be borne in mind.
First, epistemology, which has bulked so large in later philo-
<p>sophical investigation, occupied a much humbler place in the mind of
a fifth-century thinker, where it was completely overshadowed by the
search for being, or ontology. We must not expect to find it discussed
for its own sake, or with the concentration and clarity bestowed on it
in later centuries.” For Sexms on the other hand, in his writings on
Scepticism, the problems of cognition and the criteria of truth were
already central,
* *The search for being, which even as a problem is hardly understandable in Jater centuries,
<p>was the chief endeavour of Greek philosophers from Parmenides 10 Anstonle. . . . [They) primarily
and essentially investigated being and only secondanly the human faculties of grasping being’
(Weiss, CQ, 1938, 49 and §2). This 15 an impaortant and too often neglected truth, and 1t means
that fat them degrecs of hnowledge are intimately connected with, and dependent on, the degrees
af eeality in 1ts objects.</p>

Secondly, we must bear in mind the philosophical situation which the
<p>atomists had inherited. This has been graphically deseribed by S. Luria.
Democritus began to work in an atmosphere of ruin, which he could
not ignore.       He must first explain the hopeless state of the quest for
truth, and try to find 2 way out.™ In the mathematical sphere Zeno had
shown that the assumption that bodies were divisible at all implies that
any body is infinitely great, and infinite divisibility means that a body
has no magnitude atall. Yet no one can deny divisibility. In the physical
sphere he and Parmenides had shown that the objective world in no
way corresponds to the unreal and contradictory world of sense-
perception. On the other hand the outlook for the construction of an
independent world of being by the physici was poor, because by
arguments of approximately equal cogency they had reached different
and mutually exclusive results. Protagoras had denied that there are any
criteria by which to recognize an external world of being. He was
content with a ‘collectively subjective” world reached by comparing
the subjective worlds of individuals, which could be relatively and
temporarily valid for particular communities of men.                          Even this com-
promise was impossible if one adopted the standpoint of Gorgias or
Xeniades<em> that “nothing exists’. Even individual subjective worlds
cannot exist, for they too are thoroughly contradictory: the rules of
logic, whereby we test the rightness of our sensatians, are as arbitrary
as the sensations themselves. To undertake in these circumstances to
rebuild the house of truth as it lay shattered by such an earthquake
demanded scientific passion and an unshakable faith.
This leads to a third point, that the aims of the atomists were not
<p>those of empirical scientists. They had the contemporary philosophical
purpose of rescuing reality and showing in which direction it was to be
sought.     Democritus refuted Protagoras, but in origin the atomic doc-
trines, like their immediate predecessors, were designed to meet the

Eleatic challenge. Leucippus too wonld “judge by loges” as Parmenides
demanded, but claimed that logoi themselves could be reconciled with
the existence of 2 sensible world including motion, plurality and the
impermanence of individual physical things.
  Fourthly, statements which are superficially contradictory may be
reconciled by taking into account the different philosophical stand-
points of those who made them. To take the most obvious example,
Aristotle says that for Democritus ‘what is true is the phenpmenon’,
Sextus that he ‘did away with’, ‘denied’ or ‘discarded’ phénomena.
Aristotle is judging from his own dichotomy of existence into sensible
and intelligible. The archai of all things must be intelligible in his sense,
that is, incorporeal and apprehended intuitively and directly by nows,
which is not discursive reason but the soul’s power of immediate
apprehension comparable to that of sense-perception in the material
world. The first principles of Democritus were still a pact of the sensible
world, empirically imperceptible owing to the accident of smallness
(GC, 325230) but substantially the same as perceptible bodies, which
are in fact only aggregates of them.              For Democritus there is no
noumenal world to set over against the phenomenal. When                Sextus
maintains that Democtitus denied or abolished phenomena and said that
only the intelligible exists, he is not using the word in its Platonic—
Aristotelian sense but simply referring to the basic atomic doctrine
that sensible propertes are subjective impressions resulting from
alterations in our own make-up; only atoms and void have objective
existence, and they are deduced by the mind, not directly perceived
by the senses.
On a superficial view, the ancient evidence involves Democritus in
<p>the following doctrines: (a) what appears to the senses is true, (5) what
appears to the senses must be rejected, (¢) sensible phenomena lead to
 knowledge indirectly, (4) knowledge is altogether impossible, (¢) com-
 plete scepticism about the possibility of knowledge is unjustified. The
 relevant passages cannot however simply be grouped under these five
 heads separately, because Sextus makes a genuine effort to understand
 Democritus and place his various statements in relation to one another;
 and to dismember in this way a long passage (like Mazk. 7.135—7) in
                 ' Arist. GC, 325223, translaced on p. 390 abave.

<p>                          Theory of Knowledge
which he brings the several strands of thought together would be highly
misleading. With this proviso I give the evidence first.
 The following passages of Aristotle speak for doctrine (a), that what
<p>appears to the senses is true:
(i) Arist. De an. 404a27: For Democritus soul and mind were simply
<p>identical, for what is true is the phenomenon (or ‘that which appears’).
(ii) Idem, GC, 315b9: But since they [Leucippus and Democritus] held
<p>that truth was in appearance, and the phenomena were infinitely numerons,
they made the atomic shapes infinite, so that by changes in the compound
the same thing makes a contrary impression on different people; it is shifted
by a minute addition to its composition and by the transposition of a single
arom appears utterly different; for tragedy and comedy are composed of the
same letters.
(i) Idem, Meraph. 1009b12 (Where Democrits is being included in a
<p>generalization with other pre-Platonic cthinkers): in short, because they
identify thought with sensation and that with bodily alteration, they neces-
sarily say that what appears in sensation is true.   It is on these grounds that
Empedocles and Democritus and most of the others have become ensnared
by such beliefs.
Note that in these passages the statement that what appears is true is
<p>evidently Aristotle’s own. In passage (ii), what he cites from Demo-
critus in its support is taken by others (and with more justification) as
implying the opposite.      In the same passage he admits the distinction
between sensible appearances and the imperceptible atoms alongside
the statement that truth is in appearance, Evidently he saw no in-
compatibility between the two, and this can only be because he was
nsing ‘appearance’ in the wide sense, to include all bodily existence.
In the next two passages Sextus concludes that Democritus rejected
<p>sensible appearances as false:
  (iv) Math. 7.369 (DK, A110): Some have abolished all phenomena, like
Democrirus.
  (v) Ibid. 8.6 (DK, 459): Plato and Democritus considered that only the
objects of thought exist: but Democritus’s reason was that nothing per-
ceptible by sense existed in nature, whereas Plaio’s was that sensible things
were always becoming hut never being,
(vi) Jbid. 8.56 (not in DK): Democritus and Plato throw things into
<p>confusion by rejecting the senses, annihilating their objects, and holding
only to the intelligibles.
                                   457
<p>                      The Aromists of the Fifth Century
In the next passage Sextus attempts to correlate the various state-
<p>ments of epistemological import which he has found in Democritus,
Here too he begins with the rejection of appearances.?
(vii) Math. 7.135 (DK, fr. 9): Demacritus in some places abolishes the
<p>things that appear to the senses and asserts that none of them appears accord-
ing to truth but only according to opinion: the truth in things that exist is
that there are atoms and void.
After supporting this by direct quotation from Democritus (already
given on p. 440 above), Sextus continues (136):          ‘
And in his Confirmations, although he had promised to assign the power of
conviction to the senses, he is none the less found condemning them, for he
says, ‘In reality we know nothing for certain, but whar shifts accbrding to
the condition of the body and of the things which enter it and press upon it".
In this sentence from Democriius himself the relativity of sensations
<p>seems to be made the basis of a complete scepticism, or dishelief in the
possibility of knowledge about reality, and Sextus proceeds to add
several other quotations of the same tenour.
And again he says (fr. 10): <em> That we do not comprehend what is or is not
the true character of each thing has often been made clear’ (137); and in the
wark On Forms (fr. 6): </em>Man nust learn on this principle that he {s separated
from reality’, and again (fr. 7), ‘This argument too shows that we know
nothing truly about anything, but each man’s opinion is a reshaping’,<em> and
further (fr. 8), ‘ Yet it will be clear that it is impracticable to get to know the
wroe character of each thing’.
Elsewhere, however, Democtitus offered a way of escape from this
camplete pessimism as to the possibility of knowledge. Sextus proceeds

</em> The same point is repeated at Math. 8.184 and 355, which add nothing of substance to what

<p>                               Theory of Knowledge
to show how, without abandoning his conviction that the truth is not
in sense-impressions themselves, Democritus suggested that through
them the mind might ultimately be led to ir. He continues:
Now in these passages he practically does away with all apprehension, even
though it is only the senses that he singles out for attack. Bur (138, DK
fr. x1) in his Canons he says that there are two kinds of cognition, one through
the senses and the other through the intellect. Of these he calls that through
the intellect ‘legitimate’, and attests its trustworthiness for the judgrent of
truth, and that through the senses ‘bastard’, denying that it is free from
error in the discernment of truth (139). To quote his actual words: <em> There
are two forms of cognition, one legitimate, one bastard. To the bastard
belong all these: sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch. The other is legitimate,
and separate from these,” Then in preferring the legitimate to the bastard he
adds: “When the bastard cognition cannot see any further in the direction
of smallness, or hear or smell or taste or perceive by touch, but [we advance?]
to the more minute. ...
So Democritus too makes reason [logos, cf. p. 456 above] the means of
<p>judging, and calls it ‘legitimate cognition’. (40, Arr1) Diotimus® used
to say that according to Democritus there are three criteria: (1) for the
apprehension of unseen things, the phenomena, for as Anaxagoras says (and
Democritus commends him for it), ‘phenomena are the sight of the unseen’;
(2) for investigation, the conception, ‘far on every tapic, my child, there is
one starting-point, to know what the subject of investigation is’; (3) for
choice and avoidance, the feelings, for what we feel at home with is to be
chosen, but what we feel alien to is to be avoided.
This is an interpretation of Diotimus, who has recast Democritus’s
<p>thought in a post-Aristotelian mould. His threefold classification relates
it to the later division of philosophy into physics, logic and ethics. The
distortion however is mainly confined to the second criterion, for
which the only documentary support which we are offered is a garbled
guotation not from Democritus but from Plato (Phaedrus, 237b). The
first includes a valuable piece of information about Democritus himself
and can be fitted in with other testimony, and the third is borne out
by sayings attributed to Democritus like fr. 188, that the mark of

</em> The sentence breaks off here and presumably some words have fatlea out, but che sense is
n0t in doubt. The senses give us our impressions of the macroscopsc world, but when st 15 a
question of understanding the microscopic (where alone reality is to be grasped), the intellect
takes over.

what is profitable or harmful is the enjoyment or lack of enjoyment
that we feel.
The idea that the mind attains knowledge rhrough the media of the
<p>senses is strongly supported by another quotation from Democritus
which we owe to Galen:
  (viii) Galen, De medic. empir. fr. Schine, 1259, 8 (DK, fr. 125, now
incorporated into the text in Walzer’s edition of the Arabic version, p. 113).
After quoting the well-known fragment about the arbitrary nature of colour
and flavours and the reality of atoms and void only, Galen cohtinues that
after thus abusing the senses Democritus represents them as saying to the
mind: ‘Wretched mind, do you take your evidence from us and then throw
us down?    That dirow is your overthrow.”                         \</p>
</p>
<p>  In support of a sceptical interpretation we have the following, which
however can now be read in the light of the full text of Sextus on the
subject :
  (ix) Democritus fr. 117 (D.L. 9.72): ‘In reality we know nothing, for
truth is in the depths.”
(x) Arist. Metaph. 10o9b2fl. Earlier philosophers, says Aristotle, have
<p>argued that truth is not 10 be discovered by counting heads, A sick man
experiences as bitter what to others is sweet, but if most men were sick or
mad it would be the few who found it sweet who would be called ill or crazy.
‘ Therefore (b9) which of these sensations is true or false is obscure: they
are equally true, none more than another.    Hence Democritus says that either
truth does not exist or else it is hidden from us.’
To stop here however is cheating, and shows what mischief can be done
by quoting sentences withont their full context; for the next sentence is
no. (lii) above, to the effect that these same philosophers are compelled
to say that all sense-impressions represent the truth. Evidently Aristotle
saw no contradiction between the two.
(xi) Theophr. Sens. 69: [Democritus said that] things appear different to
<p>people in different condition, and again that no one person attains the truth
more than any other. This is unreasonable, for it is likely that the hetter man
would see it more clearly than the worse, and the healthy than the sick, for
his condition is closer to nature.
Here Theophrastus seems to apply to Democritus the sort of criticism
that was levelled at Protagoras, with whom we know Democritus dis-
                                  460
<p>                                Theory of Knowledge
agreed. He has already shown himself captious in this secton (p. 439
above), and in the last sentence is introducing a specifically Peripatetic
notion, that everything has its proper ‘nature’ (physis) which is its
best state. All that Democritus will have meant is that no one attains
the truth by sense-perception alone, which cannot reveal things for
what they are, namely aggregates of atoms and void.
 Finally there are one or two passages where the complete scepticism
<p>as to the possibility of knowledge, which some of Democritus’s frag-
ments might suggest, is expressly denied.
(xil) Plutarch, 4dv. Col. 1108{ (DK, fr. 156): Colotes alleges against
<p>Democritus, first, that by saying that each thing is no more this than that
he threw life into confusion. But in fact he was so far from saying that each
thing is no more this than that that he did battle with Protagoras the Sophist
for saying so and brought many convincing arguments against him. Colotes,
never having so much as dreamed of these, misunderstood the philosopher’s
language when he wrote that ‘the hing exists no more than the nor-hing’*
calling hody ‘hing” and void ‘nothing’, to bring out the point that it too had
its own nature and reality.
 (xiii) Sextus in his OQutlines of Pyrrhonism (1.213) also comments on
<p>Demacritug’s use of the phrase ‘not more’. Since it is 2 sceptic formula® it
had been thought to show that he shared the sceptics’ views. But, says
Sextus, when we sceptics say that honey is no more sweet than bitter, we
mean only to express our ignorance of whether both, one, or neither of the
sensations is real, whereas Democritus meant to affirm the unreality of both.</p>

</p>
A reading of the foregoing passage forbids us to interpret Demo-
<p>critus as a complete sceptic, denying altogether the possibility of attain-
ing knowledge of reality. Truth is indeed in the depths. If we look
only on the surface, as most men do, we remain unaware of the true
character of things. We are ‘separated from reality’ by the barrier of
the senses, which seem to tell us what things are but in fact give a false
picture. This must be the meaning of those fragments (6-8, 9, 10, 117)
which if taken in isolation seem to declare that knowledge is altogether
  ¥ See p. 392, n. 3 above. Plutarch’s quotarion of the sentence in this argument does not seem
pacucularly apt. Fram Simpl. Phys. 28. 10 and 35 (DK, 67 4 8, 68 4 38) 1t is probable that some
such phrase as olbtv nAdov Toalrov § Tawwitov elvas was used by the atomists themselves.
11 is tempting to associate it with the fact that the atoms were &amp;moie, but Brieger was probably

impossible of attainment. When Aristotle in passage (x) above credits
Democritus with the belief that either nothing is true or what is true is
hidden (or unseen), the word for ‘hidden’ (&amp;5nhAov) is one which is
frequently used to mean ‘hidden from sense, imperceptible’.t Demo-
critus did not subscribe to the thesis of Gorgias that if anything exists
we lrave no possible means of knowing it. What he did say was that the
truth must lie somewhere beyond sense-perception,                                So Sextus can
even class him with Plato as believing that only intelligibles (venr&amp;)
are real.? Plato would have vehemently repudiated the comparison.
From the point of view of his own distinction between bodiless forms
and physical objects, the atoms of Democritus belonged esseatially to
the sensible world. Yet who can estimate his unacknowledged debt to
his great predecessor? Democritus, after all, taught that reality is only
comprehensible by the mind, not the senses, that it is opposed to the
world of the senses as what is stable, everlasting, unchanging to what
is in a constant flux of change (the contrast of being and becoming),
and even that the best name for these real, unchanging, intelligible
objects was ‘forms’ (1Bécn, p. 395, n. 2 above). The materialism of
Democritus        and    the idealism of Plato present                  a truly     Herachtean
‘harmony of opposites’, reflected in a kind of love-hate relationship.
The Timaeus is constantly reminding one of Democritean doctrine,
and it can hardly be accidental that neither there nor anywhere else does
Plato ever mention his name.                 He was the arch-enemy, for to Plato
being and value were essentially linked in a teleological scheme, utterly
irreconcilable with the soulless mechanical origin of the atomic universe,
Yet he must sometimes have seen in him as it were the negative by
reversal of which his awn picture of beauty, goodness and order was
printed off.
 No extant text explains for us exactly the relationship between sen-
<p>sible experience and rational thought in Leucippus or Democritus,
Moreover, since they were clearly determined to admit no account but
a purely materialistic one, no causal factor other than physical contact,

it is unlikely that they were completely successful in relating the two.
By saying that ‘truth is the phenomenon’, Aristotle conveys to us the
conviction of Democritus that all reality is physical body, there is no
super-sensible reality, and it is by starting from sense-impressions that
the truth has somehow to be reached. The denial of objective existence
to secondary qualities gives plenty of justification for those who say
that Democritus ‘sometimes does away with phenomena’, but even
through sensation (which is after all only one form of atomic action)
we receive our first awareness not only of secondary qualities but also
of size, shape, solidity, hardness and other properties which are possessed
by the real itself.</p>
</em> Here the distinction between the two sorts of cogni-
tion comes to our aid (passage (vii), § 138 above). The senses take us as
far as they can go, and when we pass beneath the threshold of percep-
tion the mind takes over. This does not suggest a radically different
process but only a continuation to a new level of the same process, as
indeed it must be if the materialistic hypothesis is to be maintained.
No scholar, so far as I can see, has attempted to show how the
<p>atomists’ epistemology was to be explained in atomic terms. Even
Helene Weiss, whose account I have found much the most illuminating,
speaks of human understanding reaching the atoms and the void <em>by a
way of thinking which starts from the appearances and refers back, i.e.
a discursive thinking.. . . The /ogo! are an indirect grasping and mediate
thus the knowledge of true being’ (CQ, 1938, 51, n. 3). Bailey’s solu-
tion is that the phenomena ‘contain the data for the true knowledge of
the realities’, which the mind reaches ‘by inference’ (4romists, 183,
¥84). How atoms in motion can aceount for discursive thinking, in-
direct grasping and mediation, or how inference is to be explained
materialistically, are questions that they do not mention. Yet I am sure
that, inintention at least, the materialistic explanation was not abandoned
at the level of thought. Bailey is especially puzzling. We have seen his
lucid explanation of how thought occurs by direct impingement of
single atoms on the concentration of soul-atoms which is the mind
(p. 453 above). Yet when he comes to theory of knowledge, he quotes
 © Aristotle (De sens. 442b10) holds it against Democritus that he treats “common sensibles
</em>
(such as Aristotle believed to be the objects of more than one sense) as special ones, He mentions
size, shape, roughness and smoathness, aad shacpness and bluntness in solid bodies. All these,
unlike colour, favour, etc., are common to the warld of appearances and the atoms themselves.</p>

<p>                      The Atomises of the Fifih Century
the view of Brandis that ‘ Democritus thought that the mind had direct
cognizance of the atoms: far too minute to stir the senses, yet individual
atoms might stir the subtle combination of pure soul-atoms and so be
known, as the objects of sense are by the senses’, and then adds: ‘but
for such an idea there is no particle of evidence’. Is it not evidence for
that when we are told that thought, like sensation, is corporeal?                       How
else could it happen? Bailey further objects that even if the atoms could
be known in this way, the void could not, for it cannot ‘move’ any-
thing; but if one knows where atoms are, surely one kngws eo ipso
where they are not. If a few drops of acid fall on my hand; each pro-
ducing a burning sensation, they make me aware of where they are not
as much as of where they are.                             3
Certainly Democritus said (passage (viii)) that though the mind
<p>thought ill of the senses because in themselves they did not reflect
reality, yet it took its evidence from them.                 Some process of inference
is indicated, as it is also in his approval of the dictum that phenomena
are a window on the unseen. Through them, if we do not stop there,
we can hecome aware of the nature of the invisible realities.” Since it
was impossible anyway that such a crude and elementary materialism
should explain a mental process like inference, it is probably at this
point that it cannot stand being pressed too hard. At any rate certain
finer films of atoms pass right through the sense-organs or other
‘passages” in the body and impinge on the collection of pure soul-
atoms which form the mind, thus enabling it to be directly aware of the
atoms themselves. Our picture of reality is built up by combining both
modes of gnosis. Perhaps we might not even be able to interpret the
message of the microscopic atoms striking on the mind if we had not
experienced their properties of size, shape, hardness, etc., writ large in
the phenomenal world.            Moreover changes in the atomic composition
of object and percipient cause changes in the sensation produced by

their interaction. Conversely therefore the mutability and relativicy of
sensations, though throwing up a barrage of falsehood in the shape of im-
pressions of colours, sounds and tastes, can come to be seen as evidence
of changes in atomic composition. The remarkable statement that eyes
and ears, after receiving the atomic films, pass them on to be dispersed
throughout the body may just possibly be relevant to how this is done.
Something like this is perhaps what Bailey and others have meant by
<p>‘inference’. Whatever it is called, it must be susceptible of explanation
in material terms. We have not the evidence to say exactly how it
happened, and we may well suspect that if we had we should find it un-
satisfactory. One cannot see for instance how intellectual activity could
avoid playing the same purely passive and receptive role as sensation.
But this after all was a problem that still remained to worry Aristotl (De
an. 3. 4). Whatever the missing links, we may be sure of this: ‘ Leuc.ppus
and Democriws say that sensation and thought take place by the jmpact
of images from outside. No one experiences eitker without the impact
of an image’."
                       (14) Biology, physiology, medicine
<p>From the titles of the books ascribed to him, and the nature of the
scraps of information reported from them, Democritus’s biological
work must have rivalled Aristotle’s in comprehensiveness and atten-
tion to detail. But it is lost, and all that we find in later writers can do
little more than tantalize. In the apocryphal story of his meeting with
Hippocrates,? the great physician found him sitting under a plane tree
surrounded by the bodies of animals which he had been dissecting
(Hippocr. 1%, 350 L.), and there is every reason to believe that this
glimpse of him as a practical scientist is founded on fact, though at the
same time he was by no means immune from the Greek love of theor-
izing. This as well as the thoroughness of his treatment is exemplified by
the remarkable description (reproduced by Aelian, Nat. an. x2,18-20;
* Aet. 4.8.10 (DK, 67 4 30, quoted on p. 451 above). But the conjecture of Kirk (KR, 422)

physiological detail to explain the first growth, shedding and growth of
new horns, the difference between the horns of whole and castrated bulls,
and the reason why some cattle are hornless.                       In general terms the
material of the horns is a flow of moisture to the spot, drawn from the
animal’s nourishment through a nerwork of veins or channels, penetrat-
ing the bone covering the head, which is thin and membranous, and
hardened by contact with the cold air outside. Their successful growth
depends therefore on the suitability of the channels, the porosity of the
top of the skull, and more accidental features like the breadth of the
forehead. The shadow of the general atomic theory is seen in the idea
that the top of the skull is araion, meaning that the interstices of void
between the atoms are comparatively large, and in the emphasis on flow
through passages which must be of appropriate size.

gives them their night-vision. Spiders spin their ihreads from inside
their bodies like an excretion, a statement which the author of the

<p>                                Biology
 The fullest information about the biology of Demacritus, much of
<p>it from Aristotle and Aelian, concerns his views on reproduction and
embryology. The vehicle of life is pneuma, and the generative power
of semen s due (as for Diogenes, p. 378 above) to the element of breath
in it (A8t §5.4.3, A140). It is callected from every part of the body,<em>
but bones, flesh, and sinews are mentioned as the most important parts
(ibid. 3.6, A141). This seems to depend on ancient lore rather than in-
dependent investigation, when one reflects that it is precisely these three
that in the Odyssey (11.219) are said to be lacking to the shades in the
underworld. Democritus sided with Alcmaeon and Empedocles against
Anaxagoras and Diogenes in holding that both parents contributed
seed (Arist. G4, 764a6).            Differentiation of sex takes placein the womb,
but depends on whether the mother’s or the father’s seed preponderates
(as in Alcmaeon, A 14), not (as in Empedocles) on temperature nor (as in
Anaxagoras) on the distinction between right- and lefi-hand sides.
 On the order of formation of the embryo, others had argued somewhat
<p>abstractly that the ‘most important part’ must come first, and supposed it
to be head or heart according to their relative estimates of these organs;
Demoecritus more practically supposed it to be the umbilical cord, which
had to be there first to provide an anchorage for the foetus as it grew.?
After this the external parts take shape before the inner, an opinion
which earned him a rebuke from Aristotle (G4, 740a713). They are
specified later by Censorinus as head and belly, with the atomistic but
not obviously relevant comment that these have most void (6.1, 4145).
  ? For a detailed account of ancient Greek theories of reproduction and heredity (sncluding
those of the Hippocratic writers), and their influence, the interested reader may be referred to
Ena Lesky, Die Zeugungs- und Pererbungslthre der dytike und ihr Nachwirken (1950), So far as
the origin of the semen is concerned, she disunguishes three main types (p. 4):
(1) The “encephalo-myelogenic’ theory, deriving the semen from the brain and marrow (fese
<p>appeanng in Alcmaeon; see also p. 356 above).
(2) The 
</p>
</p>

<p>                        The Aromists of the Fifth Century
Democritus subscribed to the interesting theory which we have
<p>already met in Diogenes and Hippon (pp. 378, 357 above), that the
etmbryo is nourished in the womb by suckling. This is why babies know
how to apply their mouths to the breast as s0on as they are born: there
are nipples and mauths even in the womb. Zeller noted that this theory
indicated research on the lower animals, for the cotyledons, or fleshy
ourgrowths, which gave rise to the belief, are found in other mammals
but not in man." It occurs also in the Hippocratic De carnibus (ch. 6,
Vi, §92 L.), where the embryo is said to suck both nourishment and
breath through the mouth, and the same justfication for the belief is
mentioned, namely, that without this pre-natal experience it could not
take to the breast immediately after birth.* Miscarriages, said Demo-
critus, oceur mote frequently in warm climates than cold, because
warmth dilates the womb and loosens the foetns. Animals which
produce several offspring at a birth have ‘many wombs and places
which receive the sperm’.              Not all are filled at one copulation.3                Mon-

among those whom Aristotle bad in mind when he wrote in G4 (746a19) abour those who
believe that infants in the womb suck aourishment through a small fleshy growth. The Shorter
Oxford Dictionary defines a cotyledon (the actual word xoTUAnBoves 1s used wirh reference to
Diogenes but not Demoeritus) as “one of the separate patches of villi on the foetal chotion of
ruminants ', The alternative theory, that nourishmens was absorbed through the umbilical cord,
was held by Empedacles and Anaxagoras (DK, 31 A 79 and $9 A za).            Seealso ZN, rrra,n. 1,
Wellmann, FGA, 1.95. Aristotle gives as the reason why Democritus thought the embryo was
retained in the womb </em>that its parts may be formed according to the parts of the mother ’, and
contrasts this with what he believes to be the true reason, namely, the absorption of nourishment.
But this is prohably a misunderstanding, as Cherniss explains (ACP, 288, n. z55).

Plants are to all intents and purposes animals, save that they are
<p>rooted in the earth. The dubious authority of the treatise De plantis
links Democritus with Anaxagoras and Empedocles in the belief that
they have the power of thought. (Cf. p. 316 above.) The extent of his
botanical interest is illustrated by his detailed explanation (reported by
Theophrastus) of why plants with straight stems bud, fruit and die
more quickly than those which grow crookedly.?
Democritus’s works included a book of medical instruction, one on
<p>diet (or regimen), and one on prognosis, but we have little direct
information about his teaching on therapy and the maintenance of
health. Nevertheless as J. Schumacher has pointed out, there are
certain indications, in what we have already seen, of the sort of line
that he would take.3 We know of the importance of breathing, the

pueri covering the same ground as the above paragraphs may be of nterest for comparison. Seed
comes from the whole body (Gen. chh. 1 and 3), but is gathered especially from the brain and
marrow (ch. 1; cf. Democr. fr. 1 THs 8 wuyfis ol wepl Tov pueAdy Beowof, which is closely
followed by Plato, Tim. 71b, $1d). Sccd is emitted by female as well «o male (ch 4). Sex of
infant depends on whether male or female seed predominates, and semen of both men and women
contain bozk. Female-producing seed is ‘weaker” than male, but the weaker can overcome the
stronger if present in larger quanuty (chh. 6~7). Resemblance ta one or other parent in individnal
features is determined by whether the father’s or the mother’s seed proceeding from that par-
ticulas part of the bady is stronger and more effective (ch. 8). The navel is the channel both of
respiration and of growth (NP, ¢h, 15). The growth and formation of the embryo are due to
breath (ch. 17,     B edpt alfopbn Urtd ToU mveluaTos ¢pBpoTTta) and procesds on the principle
of like 1o like. This is illustrated by an experiment with earth, sand and lead filngs in a bladder
which bears out Democritus’s remarks about the behaviour of different grains in a sieve. The
author concludes by emphasizing the natural similarity between men and ‘ the things that grow
out of the earth® (ch. 27). For further derails see Wellmann in drcheion, 1929

efficiency of which depends on the structure of the body. The healthy
condition of the eye and ear is described in some detail. The general
principle seems to be that there shonld be enough void between the
atoms, and channels of the right formation, to draw in atoms from
outside, whether singly or as films or ‘images’, and give them freedom
10 move and be effective. What is said about eyes and ears suggests
that one impediment to this Is excessive dampness. The healthy state
is described generally, in terms suggestive of Alemaeon or, the Pytha-
goreans, as a correct blending of elements and properties in the body.
Thought itself depends on this, and is affected by excessive heat or cold.
The so-called ethical fragments also have some light to throw here.
<p>Like all the best ancient medical writers, Democritus attaches more
importance to a good regimen than to medicine, to prevention than to
cure. Health, he says (fr. 234), is in men’s own hands: they destroy it
through intemperate desires. (It is perbaps relevant here that he likened
the sexual orgasm to a mild fit of epilepsy.) Harmony and measure
in the body are inseparable from the same qualities in the spirit and life
in general. In a remarkable fragment (159), he imagines the body
arraigning the soul as responsible for its pains and troubles, and says
that it should win its case, for it is the soul that ruins it by neglect, in-
temperance and love of pleasure. Conversely the right state of the
body leads to that spiritual serenity and happiness the attainment of
which is man’s chief end. All this is in entire accord with atomic
theory, which teaches that the soul itself is material and that all experi-
ence, both bodily and spisitual, resulss from the entry of atom-complexes
into the organism with beneficial or disturbing effects.<em>
In general, what we know of Democritus’s work on the biological
<p>sciences does not suggest great originality, though it must never be
forgotten how miserably scanty is our information and how much
detailed description is lost.           Existing views were however adapted to

“density’ or ‘rarity’, that is, the proportion of solid to void, in various
parts of the organism, and in the importance of suitable poroi.</p>
                (15) Man and the cosmos: the origin of life
<p>It is usually accepted that Democritus was the first known Greek to
apply to man the term microcosm (mikros kosmos, ie. little world-
order; the word kosmos has by now undoubtedly acquired the meaning
‘world’, while still emphasizing the element of system and order which
distinguishes it from pre-cosmic chaos). This is a term which, with its
Latin equivalent minor mundus, became common in some Helleaistic
and Graeco-Roman circles, particularly those connected with mystical
religion of Neopythagorean or Gnostic type. Its use continued so that
Francis Bacon could write that it was ‘tritum in scholis hominem
minorem esse mundum’.’ It would certainly be interesting to trace the
phrase back to fifth-century atomism, apart from which the only pre-
Hellenistic example is Aristotle’s application of it to animals in general.<em>
If we do so, however, we must admit that it has come down to us with
no context whatsoever. The sole source is a Christian Neoplatonist of
the sixth century, David the Armenian, and he introduces it (in the
words ‘even so in man, who according to Democritus is a litcle world”)
into a comparison which is obviously Platonic.3 Hence although much
has been written about its implications, it remains largely speculative.t
Man and world are built out of the same elements, atoms and void,
following the same laws. Even the soul-atoms exist outside the human
organism, and are breathed in along with the air. This however serves
only to remind us that even if Democritus coined the phrase, the idea
of an intimate relationship between macrocosm and microcosm was far
older. The breathing-in of soul from the universe, the kinship of
organic and inorganic nature, the association of human goodness and

natural bounty in myths of the Golden Age, the emphasis on the
identity of elements in ourselves and the universe, the ordering of the
whole world on psychological principles of desire and aversion—some
or all of these ideas can be traced in Hesiod, in Anaximenes, in the
Pythagoreans, in Empedocles or Diogenes of Apollonia, Perhaps their
survival in Democritus is most marked in the universal law of like
tending to like, with its illustration from the world of living creatures,
and we have also noted that Leucippus’s account of cosmogony was
not free from the traditional language of organic growth (pp. 408, 409
above); but none of these features originates with the atomists, and the
most striking thing about their achievement is the extent to which they
freed themselves from the anthropomorphic conception of the universe
with which the microcosmic theory is most naturally linked. The
special type of rounded atoms that in conjunction with the human
frame go to form soul and mind may float about the world with others,
but this does not make the world a living, still less a thinking, organism.
Here is no ‘holy mind, darting through the whole cosmos with swift
thonghts” (Empedocles fr. 134), no ‘world a living creature with soul
and rcason’ as depicted in Plato’s Zimaeus (30b). Soul and mind are
epiphenomena, They were not there in the beginning, and played no
part in the ordering of the world.<em>
 On the origin of mankind, the only information directly attributed
<p>to Democritus (none is assigned to Leucippus) is that it arose from
water and mud, that the first men came out of the earth, and that like
other animals they owed their origin to ‘life-giving moisture’.? 1t is
probable that he also held the theory of fermentation of the earth’s
surface and the production of bubble-like membranes, inside which, as
in wombs, the first living creatures grew. This theory, which is
certainly Presocratic, has been discussed in connexion with Empedocles
(p. 210 above), and was adopted with so much of the earlier atomism
by Epicurus. In all this Democritus seems to have had little original to
offer. Theidea thatlifearose from mud and warmth metus over a hundred

                (16) Culture, language and the arss
<p> In contrast to poetic and religious ideas of a ‘golden age’ in the past,
 the fifth century saw the rise of more realistic evolutionary theories of
 hurnan culture and society. All the epithets in Hobbes’s description of
 man's life in his natural state—solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short’
 —can be paralleled in these ancient accounts of his earliest condition.
 Whether or not a religious cloak was thrown over the narrative by
 rather perfunctory reference to Prometheus or some other super-
 human power as having bestowed on men the wit 1o improve their
lives, it was by stern necessity and native intelligence that progress was
achieved. The first men lived like animals, and not even gregarious
animals. With no organization, each sought his own food and his own
cave. Lacking all technical skill, they were without houses or clothes,
domestic animals, agriculture, cookery or metals.                          Many      were     the
victims of wild beasts or disease, until the need for survival compelled
them to band together, and after many failures due to their wild and
selfish nature, the rudiments of sacial life came into existence, Gradu-
ally this developed into the higher culture of the poiis, and the arts and
graces of civilized life began to take their place alongside the purely
practical skifls. This evolutionary view of cultuse as the daughter of
necessity is to be found, identical in outline and in many of the details,
in Aeschylus,         Buripides,      Critias, Protagoras, the Hippocratic                    On
Ancient Medicine,” and the evidently fifth-century source of the pre-
history in Diodorus 1. 8. It is therefore difficult to trace its origin to any
particular thinker.? The substance of the chapter in Diodorus has been
thought to have originated with Democritus,   but must have been current
carlier. Nevertheless, though Democritus cannot have been the author of
the view, it can scarcely be doubted that he adheced to it. It isentirely in

keeping with his secular and materialistic outlook, and the suppositionis
borne out by his remarks on music (fr. 144) as recorded by Philodemus:
‘ Democritus, who was not only the most scientific of the ancients but in
industryalso second to none of whom we have knowledge, says that music
isa fairly recent art. The reason he gives is that it was not evolved! by
necessity but is the product of analready existing abundance.” The same
outlookis reflectedin hisbelief thatin some of the mast important arts men
have been the pupils of animals. Observation of the spider gave us the
idea of weaving and mending, from the swallow we acquired the notion of
housebuilding, and by imitation of the birds we learned to sing (fr. 154).
An interesting detail of the evolutionary view of society, to which
<p>Democritus contributed, was its theory of the origin of language. As
we learn from Plato’s Crazylus, two rival views of this were current.
According to one, words had a natural rightness based on an affinity
with the character of what they stood for. This idea, so difficult to
defend on any rational basis, was pretty clearly a survival of the belief
in a magjcal connexion between names and objects. In contrast to this,
it was being argued by the fifth century that words were sounds attached
quite arbitrarily to things or notions by human agency as the necessity
arose for a means of communication more comprehensive and subtle
than the grunts or cries of animals or birds. Language is an arificial
product in the evolutionary account of Plato’s Protagoras (322a),<em> and
the Diodoran history puts it as follows (r.8.3~4). When men banded
together as a protection from the beasts,
at first they utiered confused sounds devoid of significance, then gradually
began to articulate words, and agreeing among themselves on expressions
for every object, created a recognized mode of communication about every-
thing. Similar groups of men collected all over the inhabited world, so that
all did not have a language thac sounded the same, for each group compased
its words as they chanced to come. That is why there exist languages of the
most diverse character.
  ¥ &amp;moxpiven, The word is reminiscent of Anaxagoras, as Vlastos (Philos, Rev. 1946, 54) and

   That Democritus should hold a similar view was to be expected, and
<p>is confirmed by such information as we have. Though it comes from
the Neoplatonists many centuries later, there is no need to defend an
account which accords so well with the atomists’ general oudook.
Proclus in his commentary on the Cratylus (p. 5. 25 Pasquali, Democt.
fr. 26) says that Democritus took the standpoint of Hermogenes in
the     dialogue,      that names        are   not natural       but conventional,           and
adduced four arguments in support of the belief that they cannot be
essentially and naturally connected with their objects: (1) different
things are sometimes called by the same name; (2) different names are
applied to one and the same 1hing; (3) the name of a thing or a person
is sometimes changed at will; (4) it is possible to think of parallel
notions for one of which a word exists whereas for the other it does not.
The argument appears to be that if a word were an essential part of the
nature of that which it stands for, there would have to be a word for
everything. To illustrate this, he used (according to Proclus) the rather
strange exarnple of derivatives: connected with thought there is a verb
to think, but connected with justice there is no parallel verb (though,
he presumably meant, there is a corresponding action, which ought
similarly to have attached to it a single word or name).
The other reference is a little more puzzling. In Plato’s Philebu:
<p>(12¢), Socrates confesses 10 a grear fear in uttering the names of the
gods. Commenting on this, Olympiodorus asks what can be the reason
for it (p. 242 Stallbaum, Democt. fr. 142). ‘Is it because what has be-
longed to something for a long time has become sacred to that o which
it helongs, and it is unreasonable to disturb what is fixed; or because
names are naturally adapted to their abjects as is argued in the Crazyfus;
or because, as Democritus has it, even the names are <em>“ images in sound ™
of the gods?" This cryptic phrase is cited with no further explanation

</em> Iris of conrse possible for &amp;yéAvora to mean adornments, honours, ar gifts pleasing to the

we compare two other passages not expressly referred to Democcitus. There is the sentence from
Hierocles quoted by DK under the same fr. 142 where it 15 said (with particular reference to
the name of Zeus) that those who first assigned pames acted as &amp;ychucromoiol in making
them representations (elxéves) of the functions (Swéues) of their objects; and secondly the
designation of names as Syéhucra i the sense of images in Proclus {quoted under Dermocr.

a natural connexion berween names and objects, were it not that

arousing certain sensations by the movements and changes 'which they
set up in us. They are therefore as subjective as any other sights,
sounds, or other sensa.             Now the names of gods arouse dssociations
and call up our notion of them in the imagination: for a man who fears
Zeus, the utterance of his name may itself induce fear.                          In this way
divine names would themselves be ‘images’ of the gods, i.e. images of
images, twice removed from reality.                   If all the objects of experience
have themselves only a subjective existence, their names must be even
further removed from the reality that is atoms and void.” A similar
view may be reflected in the saying attributed to Democritus that ‘a
word is a shadow of a deed” (or ‘of realiry”), cited by Plutarch as a
warning against using bad language.                   A close connexion between the
two is implied,? but the general atomic theory makes it inevitable that
a word is far removed from reality.3

It is probable (many would say certain) from a passage hke Anst. Metaph. 985    b 4ff. that the
<p>atomists explicily drew the analogy between letters, syllables and words on the one hand and
atoms, atom-complexes, and physical wholes on the other. Frank (Plato u. d. sog. Pyth. 170)
draws far-reaching conclusions from this about the relation between language and reality. Others

art of song, on Homer, correct diction and unusual words, on poetry,
on the beauty of words, on euphonious and cacophonaus letters and
one or two others.           A few of his remarks on Homer are preserved in
frr. 21-5. They include speculation on the name of Eumaeus’s mother
and the nature of ambrosia. In this connexion must be mentioned his
surprising belief in poetic inspiration or divine madness.                                   Horace’s
dictum in the Ars Poerica (296)—excludit sanos Helicone poetas
Democritus—is well known. Cicero couples him with Plato as denying
that anyone can be a good or great poet without a cerrain adffatus of
madness, and Clement, ostensibly quoting Democritus’s own words,
says ‘ Whatever a poet writes with inspiration of a holy spirit (breath)
is especially fine’. Of Homer he said that he built 2 cosmos (an ordered
structure? A whole world?) of varied verse ‘hecause he possessed a
nature inspired by the divine’.
 How one longs 10 know more about this remarkable man than the
<p>scattered remnants of his achievement allow! Did he permit his
delight in great poetry 1o carry him away, and forget for a moment the
strict rationalism of his theories? Even if he tried to fit the two to-
getber, he would            hardly have taken the trouble 1o do so unless a
peculiar responsiveness to the beauty of poetry as something beyond
the common run had made him feel that inspiration was an experience
that had to be admitted and accounted for. We have seen (p. 450
above) that he regarded sopfof as possessing a kind of extra sense, and
poets were frequently given thar title. If he took the trouble to
integrate his belief in inspiration with the rest of his doctrine, we do
not know just how he did it, but it was by no means impossible.

 The subject of inspiration leads narurally to that of the gods. Sextus,
 in a general review of theories concerning the origin of the belief in
 divine powers, ascribes two to Democritus which do nOt seem com-
 pletely consistent. One is that the belief arose from alarming natural
 occurrences        such     as thunder,       lightning,     thunderbolts’
                                                                         and eclipses,
 which men in their terror imagined to be caused by gods. The other is
 more interesting and individual.                                               )
 Democritus says that certain images come to men, some of which are
 beneficent and others maleficent (whence he desired to meet with ‘pro-
 pitious images”). They are large, indeed gigantic, and hard to destroy though
 not indestructible, and they show men the future in advance, by their
 appearance and by uttering sounds. Hence the ancients, receiving a presenta-
 tion of just these images, supposed thar there is a god, though there is no
 everlasting god apart from them,
      Faced with the belief in gods, of anthropomorphic or other definite
 shape, Democritus could not on his own principles do other than sup-
pose that these were the effect of material images or atomic films, since
without the impact of such films no impression can be made on the
mind or senses. Sextus shows that he did so suppose, as does a source
in itself’ somewhat less compelling, the Hermippus now atributed ro
the    fourteenth-century               Byzantine    Catrares:     ‘Democtitus        calls the
daimones images, and says that the air is full of them.” Clement of
Alexandria, too, says that logically Democritus should allow to animals
a conception of the divine; ‘for he makes the same images from the
divine essence fall upon men and animals alike’.? Yet for Democritus
these images were not mere lifeless and ineffectual appearances from

which men had constructed an entirely false belief in beings powerful
to harm or benefit mankind. He will not indeed countenance the whole
of popular religion.         He seems to reject the notion that frightening or
destructive natural phenomena are divinely caused, and also that the
gods are immortal: like all compounds of atoms they will some time
be dissolved, though he concedes that they are exceptionally long-
lasting. But they are not hallucinatory, for ‘hallucination’ has no place
in the atomist’s vocabulary. All experience is equally subjective, the
sights and sounds of the gods no more so than any other sights and
sounds; and they can reveal the future. Itis important to our lives that
those with which we come into contact should be beneficent, and
Democritus expressed the wish that it might be so in his case. The verb
in that sentence (s0xe1o) could mean ‘prayed’, but need mean no more
than ‘desired’, and it is doubtful whether Democritus believed in the
efficacy of prayer to these beings.® Fr. 30 rather suggests that he did
not. There he says: ‘Some few of the cultured men raised their hands
to the place where now we Greeks speak of air, and said: * Zeus pon-
ders all things, knows, gives and takes away all things, and is king of
all.”’* Herc Democritus seems to be referring to the origin not of
popular anthropomorphic religion but of the more refined type which
identified God, or Zeus, with the air. This, as we have seen more than
once, far antedated the systematization of it by Diogenes (p. 369
above), and appealed to Euripides.3                  In fr. 234 Democritus complains
that men pray to the gods for health but fail to realize that it is in their
own power: they throw away their health through their own in-
temperance and lusts. This may be taken with fr. 175, in which he
departs a little from the idea of maleficent images which we met in
Sextus, and says that the gods, now and always, give men all good
things, whereas the bad and harmful we bring on ourselves by our
blindness and folly. These two fragments, however, are part of a whole

    Fr. 30 shows that just as the crudest anthropomorphism must have
its physical explanation, so also must the impression of more thought-
ful souls that the air itself is divine. In this widespread belief the ideas
of air or breath and heat were united: the nearer to fire, thé more alive

and as appears in the name aither used several times by Euripides and
elsewhere, a word which                signified only the brilliant upper air and
varied in meaning between air and fire. For Democtitus himself soul
and fire were formed of atoms of the same spherical type, and the
vehicle of the soul-atoms is air (pp. 430f., 434 above). Henceitisin the

* The point is well explained by Zeller, ZN, 1121~3. The limitations of the conception must be
<p>clearly realized, and though I have made the point befare, it is as well to repeat his wartung that
what Democritus means by the divine in this context is ‘2ot only not a personal, but not even a
unified being, not a soul but only soul-stuf, fire-atoms which produce life and movement and,
when massed together, intelligence, but not a power moving the Universe in the sense of Anaxa-

which they throw off, and Clement (a79) speaks of images ‘from the
divine substance’ as falling upon us. On the other hand Sextus says
unequivocally that there is no god apart from the images, and the
Hermippus that he called the daimones images. This however need only
mean the gods of our experience, which certainly are the images, and
may be distortions or misrepresentations of the unknowable beings
from which they have come. The word ‘images’ (eiddla) itself points
in the same direction. In a discussion of the common belief in gods,
Homer cannot have been far from Democritus’s mind, and in Homer
an eiddlon is not an independent entity but a wraith or phantom of a
real person.! Probably therefore our impressions of the gods come to
us like our other experiences of sight and hearing, through the impact
of films thrown off by bodies external to us.&gt; Even so, it is clear that
the whole of the events that Democritus is describing take place within
our own cosmos. There is no trace of the later, Epicurean doctrine of
gods enjoying an untroubled immortality somewhere out in inter-
cosmic space, the intermundia. This integrates his theology much more
closely with his science of nature. The gods or spirits that break in on
our lives from the air around us are active and personal, but subject to
the laws governing every other atomic compound in the world, liable
to disturbance and destined for ultimate decay and dissolution. The
substance of these divine or daemonic beings whose effluences stir our
consciousness will be collections of soul- or fire-atoms dwelling some-
where in the air between the earth and the confines of the universe.

<p>gods would prove to be self-consistent, there is not the evidence to

 Kapp drew attention to the Homeric usage in Griomon, 1936, 74f. Zeller also argued, against

does Alfieri (4r. 7d. 176, 181), relying on the words &amp;wd 6elos obolas in Clement,         Langerbeck
(88615, 52) took the other view, and thoughr it a point of difference between Dernocritus and
Epicurus that whereas the former held rhar the 8i8waa themselves were the gods, the latter sup-
posed them to have the function of mansmitting a transcendent god to our powers of apprehension.

judge. He made great efforts to reconcile their existence with atomic
doctrine, indeed one might say that his atomic doctrine demanded it by
postulating some external cause for every sensation and thought and
allowing no distinction in this respect between genuine and illusory
perception Yet here t00, as in the matter of artistic jnspiration, one can
sense in Democritus a conflict between his intellectual loyalty to
materialism and the existence in himself of that sixth sense of which he
speaks, which reveals the essentially non-material world of religious
and aesthetic values and refuses to deny their validity.?                           r
The gods, said Democritus, can reveal the future by appearing and
<p>by speaking (fr. 166). This they did most frequently in dreams, of
which Plutarch reports his general theory (Qu. conv. 735a-b; DK,
A77). What we see in our sleep are the films or images thrown off by
things or people, which penetrate the body through its ‘pores’. These
convey not only the physical likeness of their originals, but also their
‘movements of soul, intentions, characters and emotions’, and so when
they strike the dreamer * they speak to him like living things and report
the thoughts, arguments and impulses of those from whom they have
come’. Some are more accurate than others, depending on the state of
the air through which they have passed. Here at least the limits of
materialistic explanation seem stretched to breaking point in order to
accommodate the popular beliefs of his time. The superstition of the
evil eye is justified in similar terms: envious people emit images which
convey their own ill-will and power for harm and by implanting
themselves in the victim injure him both bodily and mentally. These
images themselves have sensations and impulses, and so mustbe thought
of as a sort of demons.? After this it is no surprise when Cicero tells</p>

his utterance eladyxwy Tuyxdvew sbdhwy (fr. 166) was the atomic version of a formula for
averting the evil eye. These curious living spectres exuded by people with the gift of overlooking
may make it more likely that other daemonic or divine €i5wha also are not self-subsistent but
representations of a more solid original.</p>

                   (18) Logic and mathematics
<p>Among the titles of Demecritus’s works is one which is usually trans-
lated On Logic, or the Canon,® and on the strength of this and some
references in Aristotle it has been claimed for him that he was the first
to have written a separate work on logic, the first to have not only
offered a philosophical system but also reflected consciously on the
logic of that system, and also the first to offer a strictly logical definition
of his ideas.<em> What exactly the word Jogike meant for him, it might be
difficult to say, but the term kanon and the reference to the Canons in
Sextus3 indicate that it was rather a work on what we should call
epistemology. It attempted to discover the criteria of human know-
ledge by discussing such questions as the relation between sensation
and thought and the relative trustworthiness of their evidence. Logika,
one may suppose, meant an investigation into the credentials of those
logoi by which both Leucippus and Democritus hoped to establish the
ontological status of the physical world (pp. 456, 459 above). The only
other reference to the work is also in Sextus, where he says that Demo~
critus is perhaps to be classed with the empirical school of physicians
who did not admit the possibility of apodeixis (demonstrationby deduc-
tive argument from first premises admitted as axiomatic ot self-evident) ;
“for he spoke strongly against it in his Canons’.# This must refer to his
insistence on giving first place to the facts of expetience rather than to
any abstract argument, and it accords with the quotation in Galen in
which the senses are represented as accusing the mind of taking its
evidence from them and then disowning them (p. 460 above).
The passages in Arstotle by no means support the claim that in
<p>his eyes Democritus was the first to offer strict logical definitions of

ideas.” Theyareall to the same effect: Socrates was the first who serfously
set himself to define the essence of things, though in a sort of way, and
toa small extent, Democritus may be said to have begun it because he at
least had some idea that a thing’s character depended on its form rather
than its marter. Thus at Pare. an. 642224 Aristotle says that earlier
phitosophers did not understand the meaning of essence or how to
define substance.        ‘Democritus touched on it first, not as a necessary
part of natural philosophy but because he was carried                             gway by his
subject. But in Socrates’s time. ..." In the Metaphysics (1678 b 10) he
says thar Socrates in his study of the moral virtues made the first attempt
at general definitions. ‘Of the natural philosophers Democritus just
touched on it slightly and in a way defined the hot and the cold; and
before him the Pythagoreans did it for a few things whose definition
they linked with numbers.” (‘In a way, says Aristotle’s Greek com-
mentator sourly, ‘ thatis, loosely and at haphazard’—probably not going
far beyond Aristotle’s own meaning.)? In the Physics (194220) he says
that both Empedocles and Democritus ‘touched on form and essence
t0 a small extent’. He is thinking of the ‘ratio of the mixture’ in
Empedocles        (as emerges       from     P4, 642a18).         The    general feature of
atomism which he had in mind in making these grudging concessions
to Democtitus was simply its doctrine that the atoms were all alike in
substance, and the different sensible characteristics of their compounds
were determined by the three basic differences of shape, position and
order. This it was which, from Aristotle’s point of view, gave hiin some
slight title to be called a thinker who recognized the essence of things
in their actuality and not simply in macter or potentiality (Mecaph.
 1042b9).</p>
There are several mathematical titles in the list of Demacritus’s

worker in this field. They also show how his mathematical theory was</p>

directed by the atomic conception of magnitude.”                               Aristotle tells us
(Ceel. 307a17) that for Democritus the sphere was a kind of angle,
which could pierce on account of its extreme mobility. In this sentence
mathematics and physics interact, for it is designed to show how
Democritus could assign spherical shape to the atoms of fire and yet
account for its destructive powers, which Plato attributed to the sharp-
ness of their angles. That conclusion however is quite likely to be
Atristotle’s, He has made the same point a little earlier (306b30f.),
where he describes the Democritean conception of the sphere as ‘all
angle’. This, Simplicius comments (Cael. 662. 10, Democr. fr. 155a),
is a reasonable description, ‘for what is bent is an angle, and the sphere
is bent all over’. Since there are atomic magnitudes which cannot be
broken down further, the sphere must be thought of as a polyhedron
with imperceptibly small faces, though to the coarser powers of the
senses it appears to be continuously curved.? It has been argued that
Democritus made this point in opposition to Protagoras, against whose
philosophy of common sense and practical utility we are told that he
brought many convincing arguments (p. 350 above). On the other
hand it has been claimed that in this matter his view and Protagoras’s
are identical3 Protagoras championed the reality of sensible things and

<p>biliey adinfiniur is sull held by some scholars, e.g. A. Wasserstein in JHS, 1963, 189, and Viastos.
Miss A. T Nicol's (Mrs Markwrick’s) article in CQ, 1936, was apparently written without knosw-
ledge of Luria’s contrary arguments, and Heath, who had originally upheld infinite divistbiley
in Democritus, was later convinced by Luria. (See next note.) To me the evidence 15 pver~
whelmingly in favour of supposing that his atomism was consistent and all-pervading, and
this is also whac his philosaphical temperament would lead one to expect. (The present sec-
tion should be read in conjunction with the appendix on pp. 503-7.) The main difficulty in
accepting this view is felr to be the knowledge         of incommensurable lines, which      must have
been available to Democritus. (See vol.1, 265, n. 2.) Among the titles of mathematical works
attribured to him there is even one mepi dAbywy ypauudv xad vagtdv, which presumably dealt

Luria. Frank, however, whom Alfieri follows, was sufficiently impressed by the common ground

nothing else: whatever geometers may say, a ruler does not rouch a
circular body only at a point. So Aristotle in the Meraphysics (997b
35): ‘Sensible lines are not such as the geometer defines them. No
sensible object is straight or round in that sense. The circle does not
rouch the straight rod at a point, but rather as Protagoras used to say
in his refutation of the geometers.” Since for Protagoras only what
appears is real, one can understand why he is represented by Plato as
including geometry among the useless subjects which can only impair
a young man’s mind (Proz. 318d—e). Now in the list of Deilocritus’s
works there is one called On difference of cognition or on the'contact of
circle and sphere,® and it is this which is supposed by the majority of
scholars to have contained an attack on Protagoras. The first of the
alternative titles, Luria has suggested (op. cit. 120), refers to Demo-
critus’s known distinction between bastard (sensible) and genuine
(intellectial) cognition. If the hypothesis of an attack on Protagoras
is correct, then (if I understand the matter rightly) Democritus was not
opposing him on behalf of contemporary mathematicians; after all, he
himself was accused of shaking the foundations of mathematics with
his indivisible magnitudes.?                        But for him, as for them, mathematics
rested on the hasic fact which Protagoras had denied, that the intellect
can reach a truth which is hidden from the senses: we may think that
1dentical, or even that the view ascribed to Protagoras by Aristotle was not his at all but only
Democritus’s (Plato u. d. sog. Pyth. 351, n. 121; of. Alfieri, Awomisti, 199, n. 502). The latcer
suggestion distorts the evidence. Frank's granmtous assumption that the “Protagoras’ of
Aristotle      might   have   been    a character   in a dialogue    rests on slender       foundations   and    is
made improbable by die use of the imperfect fAeyev. Some who have contrasted the two did
so in the belief that Democritus upheld infinite divisibility 1n mathematics, and it would
be interesting 10 know whether Heath continued to do so after Luria had caused him to give up
this helief.

our sensible experiences are real, but the only realities are the invisible

A famous fragment of Democritus’s mathematical thought is that
<p>which concerns the contiguous surfaces of the two segments of a
horizontally divided cone (Plut. Comm. not. 1079€, part in Democr.
fr. 155 ). A speaker in Plutarch is expounding a criticism of Democritus
by the Stoic Chrysippus with which he does not agree.
Again, see how he opposed a dilemma which Democritus puts scientifically
and successfully. Ifacone is cut by a plane parallel to the base, how must one
regard the surfaces of the segments, as equal or unequal?                   If they are unequal,
they will show the cone 1o he uneven, with many steplike indentations and
roughnesses; but if they are equal, the segments will be equal in diameter,?
and the cone will turn cut to be ¢ylindrical, formed of circles that are not
unequal but equal, which is absurd. Chrysippus, representing Dernocritus
as not knowing the answer, says that the surfaces are neither equal nor un-
equal, whereas the bodies [i.e. the segments] are unequal through having
their surfaces neither equal nor unequal. In laying it down that because the
surfaces are neither equal nor unequal the bodies are unequal he arrogates to
himself an extraordinary licence to write whatever comes into his head, for
the argument manifestly gives us to suppose that of unequal bodies the
surfaces are unequal.
Chrysippus was opposing Democritus from the point of view of a
<p>believer in infinite divisibility. With his ingenious theory of an inter-
mediate between equal and unequal we are not directly concerned.
Plutarch’s speaker evidently sides with Democritus, and the argument
(logos) of which he speaks is the Democritean one which he has just

</em> As Luria says (op. cit. 121), even the senses, on which Protagoras relied, enahle us to see that
the mare accurate a drawing is, the smaller is the distance over which the tangent is in contact with
the circle. When sight gives up, the ‘genuine cognition® or finer perception of the mind takes
over, and reveals that the extent of the contact is smaller than the smallest perceptible Jength.
Vlastos (Ph. Rev. 1945, 591, n. 62), who paraphrases thys, seerns (if I understand him) to think it
supports his own conclusion that there is such a thing as a mathematical tangent, touching a curve
at a single point, which is the end-point of the mind’s more subtle probing. This however would
be inconsistent with atomism (at least as I understand i) and with Luria’s own description of the
Democritean circle as in reahty a polyhedron.
* The Greek seems to be a little careless. The word mufikerra at its firse occurrence evidently
<p>means the two pieces into which the cone is cut: only so could it be possible to refer to their
surfaces. On the other hand the equality of their surfaces by no means involves the equality of
the segments, since the division might be made anywhere between the top and the hottom of the
cone. The word here must be a kind of shorthand for ' the diameter of the segments’, or alterna-
tively fox for ‘equal m diameter’.</p>

given. If his conclusion is correct, then Democritus did not leave the
dilemma unresolved but opted for the first alternative (‘of unequal
bodies the surfaces are unequal’); if the cone is not to turn into a
cylinder the lower surface of the top segment and the upper surface of
the bottom must be unequal. Hence we have a sitvation exactly paraliel
to that of the sphere which is ‘all angle’: instead of the smoothly
tapering sides which the cone presents to the senses, the genuine cogni-
tion of the mind is aware of it as built in microscopic steps, since how-
ever small the atoms             of which      it is composed,          they must        possess a
certain magnitude which cannot be broken down further.:
Another mathematical statement of Democritus is given by Archi-
<p>medes:<em> ‘Democritus’, he writes, ‘may be credited with no small
contribution ro the theorems concerning the cone and the pyramid, the
proof of which was first discovered by Eudoxus, namely that a cone is
a third part of a cylinder and a pyramid of a prism with the same base
and equal height, since he was the first to make the stateruent about the
aforesaid figure without the proof.”                   Since Archimedes says explicitly
that Democritus made the bare assertion, any explanation of how he
reached it must be conjectural, but it is usually assumed rhat it was his
search for the proof which brought him to the problem or paradoz of
the divided cone.3
  </em> Trmust be admitted that at first sight at Jeast the dilemma as given looks as if it were meant to
be a genuine one with no solution proposed by Democritus, and so it has sometimes been taken,
e.g. by Sambursky, Phys. World, 153, and Mau, Problen, 22. For Luria however it is only 2
“propaedeutic aparia’ (op. ¢ft. 140). Wasserstein, commenting, on Sambursky ( JHS, 1963, t8g),
also thinks that it was put forward as a reductio ad absurdum, but in the opposite sense: 1n his view
Democritus meant to suggest that the notion of atomic lengths in mathematics as analogous to
discrete atomic units in physics must be abandoned. He does not mention Luria’s arguments.

                       (19) Ethical and political thought
<p>Although some scholars have tried to piece together fror the fragments
of Democritus a reasoned, coherent and original ethical system, it is
extremely difficult to do so or to believe on the available evidence that
it formed an important part of his philosophy. There are two main
questions: did his ethics form a systematic scheme in themselves, and
were they integrated with the atomism of his physical system? Ante-
cedent to these however is the problem of the nature and authenticity
of the evidence itself.
Much the largest part of the material consists of two collections of
<p>separate maxims, mostly of a proverbial character,                       Some 130 of these
are scattered through the anthology of Stobaeus, and 86 are collected
under the title ‘“The golden sayings of Democrates (sic) the philo-
sopher’, first published from one manusctipt in the seventeenth century
and then in the early nineteenth from another.<em> Many of the latter are
the same as those in Stobaeus, whence it is supposed that they come
from the same source and that Democrates is either a corruption of
Democritus or a false attribution. Opinions of the authenticity of these
sayings have varied from Rohde’s ‘The “fragmenta moralia” of
Democritus are with rare exceptions. ..wholesale fabrications of the
feeblest kind’ to Schmid’s ‘As writer, thinker and personality Demo-
critus meets us most plainly in the many well attesred authentic frag-
ments preserved from his ethical work’,? but on the whole the verdict
of scholarship has been surprisingly generous.3 A final conclusion is

  3 The controversy to 1920 is summarized in ZN, 1140, n 1 (cf. 1146, n. 8, 1157), to 1935 in
DK, 11, 153f. Of more recent discussions see especially 2. Stewart in HSCP, 1958, 179. He thinks
that, if the sayings are genuine, the problem is to account for their survival over 700 years when
neither Plato nor Aristotle shows any knowledge of Democnitus’s ethics. He finds a clue in the
Cynic Demetrius (first centiry A.D.) as one full of unacknowledged Democritean tmaterial, and
concludes that they will have their origin not 1n a treatise of Democritus but 1n the compilanons
from his writings mentioned by D.L. (9.49). Having gone through a Cynic siev e, they will not
represent the style or organizaton of Democritus, and will have suffered distortion, simplification
and change of emphasis. Theur formal relation to his own works may be likened to that of che
doxography to the poems of Parmenides or Empedocles.
  I cannot alter my opinion of the fragments, even if it has not been universally shared.        O.

resting for the most part content with the vague compromise enunciated
by Diels for the Democrates collection: ‘ Investigation of the contents
forbids us either to accept them all uneritically or to reject them
wholesale.”   (DK, 11, 154.)
The grounds for suspicion are strong. Many are, even for their
<p>time, extremely commonplace and banal, and if genuine can hardly be
said to enhance the philosopher’s reputation. ‘It is good to, prevent
wrongdoing, or if not, not to take part init’ (38). ‘He who is the slave
of money can never be righteous’ (50). ‘Many speak fine words but do
evil deeds’ (53a). ‘Fools learn wisdom in misfortune’ (54). ‘Better to
think before acting than to repent afterwards’ (66). ‘Continual delay
robs actions of their fulfilment’ (81). ‘Many avoid their friends when
they fall from prosperity to poverty” (1o01). ‘Fear produces flattery
but not goodwill” (268). And so forth. Some are unoriginal, as 64, 65,
171 and 236 (echoing Heraclitus frr. 40, 119 and 85). Some are
astonishingly Socratic or Platonic. Democritus was of course a con-
temporary of Socrates and an older man than Plato, and it might be
argued that some of the thoughts which have always been regarded as
characteristic of Socrates could have originated with Democritus. But
in the absence of any external evidence for this, especially in Aristotle,
who though an admirer of Democritus always gives Socrates the credit
for originality in this respect, such an assumption would be highly
dubious. Most striking is fr. 45, ‘He who does wrong is more unhappy
than he who suffers it’. (Cf. Gorgias, 479e. Contrast however fr. 193
which recommends vengeance.)        There are also the following,     ‘Men
are not made happy by the body or by wealth, but by rightness and full
understanding’ (4o, also 77 and 171; cf. 4pol. 30b). ‘It is vain to
admonish the man who thinks he has wisdom’ (52). 181 (ad fin.) and
214 emphasize the unity of courage with the rest of virtue.         (‘He is
brave who overcomes not only the enemy but pleasures.”)         173 makes
the same point as Meno, 88a, that good things may be turned to bad
by ignorance of how to use them properly, and 181 ad fin. identifies
right action with knowledge. ‘The gaod eros’, which is ‘a longing for
what is fine without Aybris® (73), is twin brother to Platonic eros,

Stobaeus is supported by fr. 4 from Clement, and fr. 276 contains the
same advice against having children as Clement also ascribes to
Democritus.            (See DK, A170.)        Just a few have a shrewd or original
touch which lifts them a little from the ruck.                     Fr. 222 points out that
saving for one’s children may be only a form of miserliness, and one
cannot but be struck by the attitude to sex in 271, which makes love
the touchstone: ‘a woman who is loved may indulge desire without
blame’.3 Three sayings in the Demacrates collection (62, 68, 89) assert
that in assessing a man’s worth, intention is no less important than
action. One or two which have been thought to link up with the
atomic theory will be discussed later. The prevailing effect is of home-
spun practical wisdom, with a distinct leaning towards prudence and
safety first, ‘Liberty of speech is a mark of freedom, but to judge the
right time for it is risky’ (226). For fence-sitting and avoidance of
committal it would be hard to beat fr. 253:

repute and even maltreatment. To err is unavoidable, but to be pardoned is
not easy.
The same spirit pervades the remarks about children. Their upbringing
is treacherous; even if successful it is full of struggle and care, and its
failure exceeds all other anguish (fr. 275). Hence it is best to have none
(276), but if you feel a need for them, then adopt a friend’s rather than
begetting your own. You can take your choice from those}you know,
instead of having to put up with whatever an unpredictable baby turns

The fragments themselves do not suggest that Democritus offered
<p>any contimious or systematic exposition of ethical theory.t Aristotle’s
evidence, as has often been remarked, points in the same direction:
Democritus is a physikos, and Socrates the founder of ethical philo-
sophy. There are however several titles under the heading of ethics in
Thrasyllus’s list of his works, including one on euthymiz, which may
he translated as cheerfulaess ar contentment.? In so far as he had any
definite doctrine, it lay in the exaltation of this quality as the zelos or
goal of living.          In practically the only doxographic statement on the
subject, Diogenes Laertius writes (9.45):
The telos, he holds, is contentment.                   It is not the same thing as pleasure,
as some have erroneously taken it to be.                      Rather it is that by which the

life of the soul is made calm and stable, undisturbed by fear, supersti-
tion or any other emotion. He calls it also well-being, and by many other
names."
Among these names were the one which Epicurus took over, ataraxia
(meaning freedom from distutbance), and athambia or imperturh-
ability,<em> and in fr. 31 Clement says that Demaocritus compared the
purging of emotion from the son! by wisdom to the healing of the body
by medicine. The word pathos used here, which in a psychologjcal
context means emotion or passion,3 covers a very wide field, for it con-
notes any way in which a subject is changed, wrought upon or affected.
So sensation is for Democritus a patkos of the perceiving subject when
disturbed by a rain of atoms, and it differs with the individual because
each individual’s constitution differs according to pathe and age.# The
various senses can hardly have been dissociated in his mind, and the
aim in life is evidently to avoid all possible disturbance of any kind,
mental or emotional disturbance being of course as much a material
phenomenon as any other, The feelings,it is true, have their usefulness,
for if the obscure Diotimus is to be trusted here, we should let them be
our guide in what is to be sought and what avoided;5 but we use them
only in order that, by choosing what suits us best, we may keep
emotional disturbance to the minimum. This involves taking the least
possible action either in public affaits or privately, and always keeping
well within one’s powers (fr. 3).

between pleasures, than which, said Democritus, nothing is better or
more advantageous for a man(Stobaeus, A 167; cf. fr.233). Itis secured
by moderation in enjoyment and a balanced life: pleasures should be
neither lacking nor excessive (fr. 191). Self-control is praised in
several fragments (208, 210, 211, 214, 294). It increases pleasure (211),
and the rarity of pleasures enhances their enjoyment (232). The need
far discrimination in their choice also recurs in the fragments (71, 74,
207). One of the maxims in Stobaeus even says that to achieye con-
tentment a man should not find his pleasure in mortal things.” The
philosophy of contentment is evidently no vulgar hedonism: rather it
foreshadows the ‘art of measurement’ in pleasure of which Socrates
makes himself the champion in Plato’s Prozagoras, This at least finds no
contradiction in the many maxims ascribed to Democritus, which as
we have seen are unadventurous and strongly biased in favour of
prudence and the safe middle way. Like Socrates he would be entirely
opposed to the unbridled ambition and greed of a Callicles, as is shown
also in his exaltation of the old Hellenic virtue of aidds, an inner feeling
of respect for what deserves respect and revulsion from wrongdoing as
such and not from fear of punishment.? Self-respect and shame before
one’s own conscience should keep one from doing a wrong even if no
other man will know of it (frr. 244, 264, 84). Here he takes a firm stand
against the attitude of some contemporary Sophists, like Critias who
suggested that the gods were invented because fear of punishment by
them was the only possible means of preventing wrongdoing in
secret.3 He also pronounced on another burning question of con-
temporary ethics, the part played by natural disposition and training
respectively in the production of virtue. Training has the leading part,4
but it can in fact change a man’s disposition so that virtue becomes
a second nature (fr. 33).
In all this Democritus shows himselfto be not only the climax of the
<p>impressive line of lonian pysici but also a contemporary of the Sophists
  <em> Fr. 189. If this «s genuine, one can only suppose that in his ethical precepts Democrirus

and an acrive participant in the controversies about human nature and
conduct which occupied the centre of the philosophical stage, especially
at Athens, in the middle and later decades of the fifth century. This
emerges also from the fragments dealing with political thought and
public affairs, which were none the less worthy of his attention because
‘contentment” demanded that we should be involved in them as little
as possible. In fifth-century Greece they could leave no one unaffected,
but at least he can plead that intestine strife is an unmitigared evil (249),
and only by a spirit of internal harmony can a city achieve anything in
peaceor war (250). Inaremarkable passage (255) he says that when the
upper classes are generous, helpful and kind to the poor, the resulting
compassion, solidarity, comradeship, mutual assistance and harmony
are of incalculable benefit. He is a democrat, for whom poverty in a
free democracy is better than prosperity under autocratic rule (251).
Good government is all in all (252), and the political art should be
thoroughly mastered (157). A bad ruler should be blamed, but a
good one deserves no special praise, since he is only carrying out the
duty for which he was elected.” His humane sentiments (could one say,
like Plato’s?) applied only to law-abiding citizens within one’s own
state. External enemies and disturbers of the peace like thieves and
pirates are to be killed without compunction (259, 260).
As a child of his time Democritus had to show where he stood in the
<p>controversy of ‘law’ versus ‘nature’. Should one bow to nomos
(custom or convention, crystallized in law) or follow physis, nature,
which some Sophists exalted in contrast with it? In their view the
stronger had a natural right to power, and law and custom were only
a device to thwart this in the interests of the weak (synonymous with
inferior). In his physical theory Democritus had gone so far in this
direction as to contrast nomos with reality. Our sensations existed only
by nomos (conventionally, or in general belief), whereas in reality there
were only atoms and void (fr. 9, p. 440 above). But in practical life
(as by now will be expected) he upheld it, in the narrower sense of law.

‘The “contented” man is inclined to what is lawful and just’ (17.4).
“The restraint exercised by the laws on individual freedom is solely to
prevent men from injuring one another’ (245). ‘The aim of the law is
to benefit human life, but it can only do so when men are willing to
accept its benefits: 1 reveals its excellence to those who obey’ (248).
Law then, though good, is not all-powerful, for one cannot make men
virtuous by force, but only by persuasion. ‘By encouragement and
persuasive words one will prove a more powerful advocate of virtue
than by law and compulsion; for he who is kept from Wrokg by law is
likely to sin in secret, but he who is brought to duty by conviction is
unlikely to err either in secret or openly. Wherefore the man who acts
rightly from intelligence and knowledge becomes both courageous and
right-minded’ (181).* The high status of nomos comes out especially in
ane of the exhortations not to be tempted to do wrong by the thought
that no one will discover it. The quality of self-respect which makes
this impossible ‘should be established as a romos (law) in the soul”
(fr. 264). Here the pryche is the centre of moral and rational being as it
is in Socrates, and nomes is far removed from the sense of mere conven-
tion or subjective belief in which, in the atomic philosophy of nasure,
it is contrasted with reality.?</p>
 A case for the integration of Democritus’s physical and ethical
<p>theory was put forward by O. Gilbert in 1911, but not very success-
fully. More effective have been the recent arguments of von Fritz and
Vlastos.3 Here we must be brief. We know that sensation and even
thought depend on a physical alteration caused by the movement and
rearrangement of atoms. Since the soul is itself an atomic compound,</p>
<p>  <em> The duty of the Jawgiver to use persuasion rather than threats is similarly emphasized by
Plato in the Laws (8pob-d).
  </em> The Christian Epiphanius (fourth century), in his refutation of heresies, ascribes to Demo-
critus what seems ar extreme antinomian position (3.2.9, DK 68 A166): ‘He said that the laws
were an evil device, and that the wise man must not submit to them, but live in freedom.” This is
a complete misundersranding (cf. ZN, 1149, n. 43 Aleri, diomisti, 177, 0. 4523 Ar. Id. 203, 1.1,
which could perhiaps have had its origin in Democritus’s denial of an absolute validity to law and
tus asistence that 1t canaot prevent secret wrongdoing, for which 86 and affds are the only
remedy. The véyes 1] yuyi} kafeords (fr. 264) is certainly different from law in its commanly

it would be only consistent to suppose that character is moulded in the
same way, and there is something in the language of Democritus to
suggest that it is, Compounds of the word rhythmos, which in his
terminology meant ‘shape’ (p. 393 above), are used in ethical contexts,
just as in the field of knowledge opinion was described as ‘reshaping’
(p. 458).      His comment on the current question of the relationship
between natural disposition and teaching is worded thus: ‘ Nature and
teaching are similar: teaching re-forms a man, and by re-forming
creates his nature.’<em> Fools are ‘shaped’ by the gifts of fortune, but
understanding men by those of wisdom.? Vlastos also makes a point of
the fact that words related to ‘ turning’ (sropé), used by Democritus for
the position of atoms, are also applied to moral qualities.3 However, the
strongest evidence for the theories of von Fritz and Vlastos isin fr. 191,
where moderate pleasures and a balanced life are said to be necessary  for
contentment because excess or defect of pleasure ‘causes change and
brings about great movements in the soul ; and souls that are moved
over large intervals are neither stable nor contented’. The language
here, as von Fritz says, can hardly be metaphorical.                         Disturbance and
scattering of the soul-atoms are prejudicial to peace of mind.t Together
this evidence is sufficient to show that even when writing of conduct
and the telps of life, Democritus did not always forget his universal
materialism. But it does not suffice to explain how far he went, or how
successful he was, in attempting a systematic integration of the two.

any comparison with later developments of the atomic theory of matter.
To make such a comparison adequately would call for a more than
superficial understanding of physies down to the present day, and a
lengthy treatment of changing theories through the centuries.! For
Newton and the classical physics of the nineteenth century, atoms were
still basically what they were for Democritus: ultimate units of matter
which were hard, impenetrable, ponderable, immutable.                           But already
the inadequacy of these units by themselves, with the sole additional
assumption of void or ‘not-being’, 1o explain the complexity of
phenomena       was apparent.         For Democritus action at a distance was
impossible, and everything must be accounted far by the actual impact,
entanglement and separation of atoms of different shapes. The hypo-
thesis displayed both courage and ingenuity, but in fact could explain
no more than the simplest physical processes. The complexities of
chemical change, and the higher forms of organization and directive
activity culminating in life and consciousness, proved to demand more
subtle processes and the introduction of forces capable of acting over
greater or smaller distances. From Newton onwards scientists have
spoken in terms of ficlds of force—gravitational, electric, magnetic and
others—involving the concepts of continuity and action at a distance,
both of which were strictly forbidden to the atomists by the terms in
which their own philosophical problems were set. Even so, the atomic
structure of matter itself was basically unaltered; the forces acting on
it, though their precise nature raised difficulties, could still be regarded
as distinct from the matter acted on. It is the virtual abolition of this
distinction in recent years, the change in the status of microphysical
entities from permanent particles to what some would prefer to call
events,? that has made the concepts of modern physics so fundamentally
different from those of Democritus. It should however be mentioned,
before leaving the subject, that the Democritean was not the only form
of atomism bequeathed to us by Greek philosophy.                             According to

Toulmin gives as the reason for its limitations the metaphysical prob-

adds that science has broken away from the dilemma only at the cost
of postponing the metaphysical questions); and Popper sees the basic
problem of the Eleatic school, and so of Democritus, as that of the
rational understanding of change, which ‘still remains the fundamental
problem of Natural Philosophy’.! One may mention in conclusion
some of the philosophical problems which the atomists either raised for
the first time, or at least brought into sharp focus and made inescapable.
1t is in raising and formulating questions, rather than in providing
definitive answers,          that the fruitfulness of sixth- and fifth-century
speculation is chiefly to be found.
  The atoms, it is clear, are an intellectual hypothesis to explain
phenomena. This immediarely raises a question in a philosopher’s mind.
Are they only physically, empirically imperceptible because of their
small size, or are they imperceptible absolutely and in theory, being no
more than constructions of the intellect? Such theoretical construc-
tions have been seen at various periods to be valuable instruments of
scientific advance,<em> down to the mathematical ‘world-image’ of the
twentieth-century physicist. This, said Planck, is ‘merely an intellectual
structure. To a certain extent it is arbitrary.” It is </em> due to our imagina-
tion and is of a provisional and changeable character. ..an artificial
human product’3 Yet by its employment we attain a deeper under-
standing of the physical world itself. In an interesting discussion, Dr
Toulmin notes in Democritus a certain ambiguity in the status of the

from seeing or feeling them. At others, he argues that they both Jo
and must escape our senses.” [ do not agree that the sentence ‘Man is
separated from reality’ (fr. 6, p. 458 above) necessarily implies the
absolute or theoretical imperceptibility of the atoms, but the repeated
statement in our authorities that the atoms have no sensible qualities
may be thought to say the same thing. (See especially p. 393 with n. 4
above.) Toulmin’s conclusion is that Democritus explaited both
interpretations, as Eudoxus may have done with the hy&amp;othesis of
celestial spheres in astronomy.” My own impression is that Democritus
was not so conscious of the problem as these words imply. Perhaps it
could hardly arise untl Plato and Aristotle had made explicit the
distinction between sensible and intelligible existence. (Compare what
is said about Demoeritus’s attitude to phenomena on p. 456 above.)
In any case it can bardly be right 1o say that, besides being too small
to be seen, his atoms ‘only existed in a manner of speaking, since one
could discover what was really going on in the world only by hypo-
thesis and rational inference’. This is not the logic of Democritus, who
had learned his lesson from the Eleatics: what is reached by rational
inference is the only thing that has absolute and unqualified existence.
At the same time it belonged to the physical—that is, material—world,
since for him there was no other.
Though Anaxagoras had put forward the notion of the infinitely
<p>small (p. 289 above), it is probably true that it was Leucippus and
Democritus ‘who made the question of theinfinite divisibility of matter
a basic question of philosophy’.? They excited the rivalry of atomic and
continuum theories which has persisted to the present day.3 It was not
long before the Stoics put forward the opposite view in what has been
claimed as ‘the first consistent and elaborate continuum theory of
matter’,4 and continuum theory was to be the successful rival of

<p>                          Fundamental Problems Raised
atomic for many centuries. Again, their explicit refusal of existence to
anything but what was solid and impenetrable, anything but ‘matter’
in its most uncompromising form, brought philosophers for the first
time face to face with the problems raised by an avowedly materialistic
philosophy. Henceforth they had to make the choice whether to be
materialistic or not, and justify it with argument.                       The ambiguous
status, in this respect, of mind in Anaxagoras was no longer a possibility.
With characteristic intellectual courage Leucippusand Democritus tried
to reduce even life, consciousness and thought to the reciprocal action
of atoms in contact with each other. They failed,’ but by showing how
far one could go even with such primitive concepts as theirs, they encou-
raged the faith of all who in later ages have been attracted by the notion
of man as a machine: might he not be simply a more complicated and
highly developed machine than the intellectual and experimental
resources of the ancient atomists allowed them to suppose? The mind—
matter dualism of a Descartes would have seemed to them a betrayal of
principle, that same principle which was reaffirmed by Julien dela Mettrie
in the eighteenth century in the words: “Let us then conclude boldly that
manisamachine, and that the wholeuniverse consists only of a single sub-
stance [Matter]subjected to different modifications.’</p>
</em> Related to this is the
choice between mechanism and teleclogy.                     Is function determined by
structure or structure by function?                 Has matter formed itself unaided
into organisms of an almost incredible complexity, delicacy and adapt-
ability to purpose, or has this order and efficacy been imposed from
outside by a rational agent working to a plan? To put it another way,
should the animate world be modelled on the inanimate, or should it
be the other way round? Hylozoism had not really posed the question,
nor was it settled by traditional Greek religion as it is by Christianity.
Anaxagoras         and more         particularly Diogenes         of Apollonia inclined
towards the ordering of matter by mind, but it was Democritus who
first compelled philosophers to take sides by his detailed exposition
of a system in which intelligence, direction and purpose were epi-
  <em> This was perhaps inevitable. ‘ There is something in the internal logic of a purely atomistic
theory which necessarily debars it from solving the problems of organization and directed
activity® (Toulmin, op. cit. 64).

phenomena emerging at a late stage from nothing but the undesigned
clash and recail of individually inanimate particles. Now it stoad forth
starkly and could no longer be ignored. The reaction was swift. In the
pages of his younger contemporary Plato, though the name of Demo-
critus is never mentioned, one can sense the shock of hostility which
he and those who thought like him had aroused. Democritus and
Plato fought the first round in a contest which still continues and can
never be decided by reason and observation alone.
Is reality to be discovered by deductive theory or sensible bbserva-
<p>tion?    Or rather, what is the relative importance to be attached to each
in the search for it? No one but Parmenides had had the audacity to
rely wholly on theory in flat contradiction of sensible experience, and
even he, when he had stated the ‘truth’, felt compelled (from whatever
motives) to append a long description of the origin and structure of
the ‘false’, phenomenal world. To this problem of scientific method
Democrims made a permanent contribution by his distinction between
the two modes of cognition. Phenomena and reality are so related that
the shifting panorama of the former is an impression made on our
senses by the permanent realities of which both our own bodies and the
external world are composed. Consequently the principle is established
that the investigator must start from phenomena, and though reality
lies beyond them and is reached by theory, the only theory admissible
is one which does not contradict, but explains them:<em> ‘ Phenomena are
the sight of the unseen.” Connected with this is the first statement of
the distinction between what were later to be known as ‘primary’ and</em>secondary’ qualities and for Democritus were the object of “ legitimate’
and ‘bastard” knowledge respectively. This is essentially the distinction
whose revival is often credited to Locke, though it is made in the
clearest possible terms by Galileo,<em> and which Berkeley and Hume
rejected in favour of the more sceptical conclusion that the so-called
primary qualities are just as subjective as the secondary. Once again
the first step in an age-long controversy was taken by the atomists of
the fifth century B.c.
  ? This point is well expressed by Popper (op. ¢it. 82), who adds: </em> This philosophy has remained
fundamental to the whole devalopmeac of physics, and has canunued ta conflict wieh all “celativ-
ishic” and <em></em> posinvistic” tendencies <em>

                    INDIVISIBILITY              AND     THE    ATOMS
<p>The question whether the atoms of Leucippus and Democritus are
only physically indivisible (a-tomic), because of such attributes as
solidity and impenetrability, or also logically and mathematically in-
divisible, has been under lively discussion in recent times, The discus-
sion continues. Professor Gregory Vlastos, in particular, is engaged
on a thorough re-examination of the evidence, from which he con-
cludes that the atoms of Democritus are indivisible for physical
reasons, but infinitely divisible as portions of the three-dimensional
extensive continuum, i.e. if regarded mathematically. The evidence
is complicated and sometimes conflicting, and [ make no claim to be
saying the last word on it. What follows must be read with this
proviso.
In the text I have emphasized what was for the Abderites the primary
<p>condition that their atoms had to satisfy, namely                           the Eleatic (and
especially Parmenidean) canons of unity. What is one must be free
from any possibility of change, not susceptible to addition or subtrac-
tion, a plenum, continuous and indivisible. It is a single whole, without
parts, on the primitive logical ground that one and many are contra-
dictory attributes which cannot apply to the same thing. Thus whether
or not these arguments would satisfy a more mature or mathematically-
minded thinker, the atoms were for Leucippus and Democritus without
parts, logically as well as physically indivisible, although each was a
physical body possessed of a certain magnitude. The infinite divisibility
of matter was inconceivable.
The most important evidence is in Aristotle, GC, 316 a14fF., Demo-
<p>critus’s point-for-point’ reply to the Eleatics.’ If body is divisible
‘throughand through’ (wéwrn), suppose it to be so divided. What s left?

therefore implies that magnitudes can come from non-magnitudes
(&amp; piy peyedéov usyedos evan 316 b §), which is absurd.                 (Democritus,we
notice, drew from infinite divisibility the same                      conclusion which
Anaxagoras thought would follow from a limit of divisibility, p. 289,
n. 2above.) Moreover Aristotle, who did believe in infinite divisibility,
speaks of Democritus’s contrary view as ‘necessarily in conflict with
mathematical science’ (De caelo, 303220, cf. 27:1b10).
For a fuller treatment of this question, see S. Luria, Die Infinitesimal-
<p>theorie der antiken Atomisten (Qu. u. Stud. 1932, €sp. pp. 119-29) and
J. Man, Problem des Infinitesimalen (1954, 2nd ed. 1957). The Demo-
critean arguments in Aristotle were discussed earlier by I. Hammer-
Jensen, D. und Platon (Arch. f. Gesch. d. Phil. 1909-10).<em> Luria’s
exposition is brilliant and indispensable, yet the conclusion of his final
section, though argued with his usual acumen, cannot be accepted.                         He
supposes that there were two kinds of atom. The one, out of which the
physical world is built up, is physically indivisible because of hardness,
solidity and so forth, but actually has parts and is therefore mathe-
matically divisible. The other is mathematically indivisible because
without parts (duepns). ‘Atoms’ of the first kind (one would surely
have to put the word between quotation marks) are divisible into those
of the second. This, as Luria agrees, involves assuming a state of things
of which neither Aristotle himself nor any later commentators had any
apprehension.       Even more important is it, I should say, that on this
hypothesis the atoms on whose characteristics Leucippus and Demo-
critus relied for their proof that a physical universe could be accounted
for without contravening the logic of Parménides, would utterly fail
to satisfy that logic.!
Luria’s final thesis has been denied by Mau (Problem, 24~7), who
<p>however surprisingly fails to mention Luria’s first and most striking
piece of evidence.&gt; Commenting on Aristotle’s criticism that Leucip-

</em> It might be thought that they were paying attention here rather to Melissus. The atoms had
a certain bulk, and Melrssus had said (fr. g} et It wéxos [se. 75 8] Ixan &amp; udpra. But we have
seen already that it was Parmenides rather than his followers whom they respected. They could
not meet Melissus by suppesing the atoms ta have parts, for then these parts would have to be
without magaitude and once again one would have péysos &amp; uf ueydis.
  * Presumably he felt excused from doing so on the grounds that ‘wenn wir in dieser Frage von

Neither do they explain weight in the atoms, for they say that the part-
less entities which are assumed for the atoms and are parts of them are
without weight. Yet how could weight be derived from a combination of
entities without weight?
Our lack of the atomists’ own              writings, and dependence            in part on
commentators who lived from §00 to toao or more years later, must
inevitably lead sometimes to almost insoluble difficulties.                   From what
we have already seen, I do not think this can be accepted as a historical
statement.    Nor    can    it be supported          from the pépiax uév #xsw of
Simplicius, Phys. 82.1, since Simplicius himself contradicts this by the
Suepts of 925. 1. (See below for these passages.) The impossibility of
producing   a weight from weightless parts is advanced by Aristotleagainst
the Pythagoreans ( Metaph. 1090a30) and Plato (De caelo, 299b15), but
never against theatomists. In spite of his general good sense, itlooks asif
Alexander had confused these different (thoughalso in someways similar)
theories of the structure of reality, and our suspicion is confirmed by his
immediately fo)lowing words: ‘ This is discussed more fully in the third
book of the De caelo’, where in fact Aristotle is criticizing Plato.t
Some see a difference between Leucippus and Democritus in the
<p>reasons which they alleged for the indivisibility of the atoms.                       Alfieri
(Arom. Id. 66) thinks it probable (in spite of Simpl, Phys. 925.13, DK
67 A 13: Leucippus and Democritus artributed their indivisibility to
impassivity, smallness and lack of parts) that Leucippus alleged only
sraliness and lack of parts, impassivity (&amp;¢wéBeis) being added by
Democritus. Kirk says the same (KR, 408), though in the sole passage
which he quotes (from Galen) one would think that of Tepi Aetimmov,
contrasted as it is with of mepi <em>Emikoupov, is poor evidence for
separating Leucippus from Democritus. (The view goes back to von
Arnim, and has been refuted by Luria, op. ciz. 125.) Bailey (4tomists,
781.) attributes all three properties to Leucippus, though dwédeix was

‘elaborated on’ by Democritus. Here as always, the touchstone must be
the necessity which Leucippus felt to pay heed to Eleatic logie. &amp;méSeais
such an essential characteristic of the One of Parmenides that he is most
unlikely to have overlooked it. At Simpl. Cael. 242. 18 (DK, 674 14)and
Phys.82.2(notin DK) it is said to be anecessary consequence of solidity.
(So alsa D.L. 9.44 and Plut. 4dv. Col. 11113, 68 &amp; 57. The testimony
obviously comes from Theophrastus, who calls the atom &amp;mro®és in Caus.
Plant. 6.7.2,68 &amp; r32.) Thus all the Eleatic properties of immutability,
continuity, 1nd1v151b1hty and ‘fulness’ appear closely linked u{An the atom,
One would like to agree with Man when he says (Proé[em, 19) that
<p>from what we know of Democritus he did not, any more than his pre-
decessor, argue the indestructibility of the atoms from their'smallness
and lack of parts, but only from their solidity and lack of internal void.
There does however seem to be evidence that Leucippus thought of
smallness as contributing both to the indivisibility and to the general
amédaa of the atoms.     Indeed, if one were to suppose any difference
between the two, it might lie in this, that Democritus saw the weakness
in the argument from smallness and lack of parts. (It was open to
Zeno's objection that the atoms would then have no exrension at all,
and again, so far as size is concerned, to an argument given by Philo-
ponus, GC, 175.7, that if the atoms were only indivisible because of
their small size, they would not be truly—gUos—atoms. After all, he
says, even those who do not believe in atoms do not carry out division
10 infinity. They realize that smallness must bring actual division to a
halt, but believe that no body is by its nature indivisible: all are
potentially divisible to infinity.) Simplicius at Phys. 81. 34 enumerates
three ways in which something may be indivisible. The second and
third are: ‘(2) that which in its own nature cannot be divided, like the
point and the unit, (3) that which bas indeed parts and magnitude but
is impassible owing to solidity and compactness, like each of the atoms
of Democritus.”   Nevertheless in view of the frequency with which
bath authors of the atomic theory are named together, and the un-
certainty whether a meniion of Democritus alone includes what he
learned from Leucippus, I do not myself think that any of these com-
plicated arguments from isolated sources are very profitable. Simplicius
himself, at Phys. 925.13 (DK, 67 A 13), cites Democritus as well as

Leucippus for the oumpdu xod &amp;uepés of the atoms. Either he was
confused, or in the general, exhaustive statement of all conceivable
kinds of indivisibility he was interpresing the atoms of Democritus as
they must appear to a post-Aristoteiian philosopher for whom every-
thing that has magnitude must have parts.®
In concluding that for Demoeritus at least the atoms were both
<p>physically and mathematically indivisible, I have not been uninfluenced
by the general impression, which has been left on me by the experi-
ence of living with his remains for a year or more, of his strongly
individual philosophical character. He appears as an atomist through
and through, with all the exaggerated faith of a pioneer in the new
theory, and it is improbable that he would admit mathematical
considerations as an exception to the physical and metaphysical reasons
which caused him 10 postulate atomic magnitudes. He had a mind
which naturally saw things in concrete terms, and would not wish
to admit any distinction between               physical and        mathematical        modes
of being. His apparent disregard of the mathematical science of
his time (of which he was certainly not ignorant) was due not so much
to more primitive thinking as to his out-and-out materialism.                         At this
period of philosophy the overriding questions were ontological, and
the mathematical views of philosophers were not independent of their
answers to the great ontological questions. His main concern is with
the problem of reconciling the phenomenal world with Parmenidean
canons of Being, and his conclusion is that Being—all that is—mmst be
divisible but not infinitely divisible. On this contention his whole philo-
sophy rests. ‘ The statement that atoms are indivisible is an ontological
proposition.’<em> Ifinfinitely divisible magnitudes are admitted in any sense
whatever, theatomic philosophy of Being falls apart, since thereis noclass
of mathematical ‘beings’ distinet from physical. He had learned from
Parmenides the lesson of the Pythagorean fallacy. Mathematics could
only be an object of ‘genuine’ as opposed to ‘bastard’ cognition, and
this, we may be sure, reveals nothing but the atomic structure of realiry.
  </em> It occurs 10 me as a possibility that Simplicius might have misunderstood Aristotle’s words
at Phys. zo3b1, neytde kard pépia xal oxhuem Bagtpov, as refernng to the atoms singly in-
stead of to therr common substance which is ‘divided quantitatively” into parts which are the
atoms. His népiax pdv #xaw xad péyedos could be an echo of this passage.
