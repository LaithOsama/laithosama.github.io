This is a transcript of the first thirty-five minutes of the first lecture of acourse on “The Philosophy of Politics” that Dugin gave at Moscow StateUniversity in 2014.

It is a discipline thatconsiders the philosophers who engage in politics, the philosophers whowrite about politics, and the political actors who base their laws, the

When we speak of the philosophy of politics, weare talking about the essence of politics, of that which makes politics
