<h2>Chapter 1: The Two Faces of Putin</h2>
<p>
In the first chapter of Putin VS Putin, Alexander Dugin argues that Vladimir Putin is a complex and contradictory figure. He argues that Putin has two faces: a liberal face and a conservative face.
</p>
<p>
Dugin argues that Putin's liberal face is the face that he shows to the West. This face is the face of a modernizing leader who is committed to economic reform and integration with the West.
</p>
<p>
Dugin argues that Putin's conservative face is the face that he shows to Russia. This face is the face of a traditional leader who is committed to Russian values and interests.
</p>
<p>
Dugin argues that the two faces of Putin are in conflict with each other. He argues that Putin is torn between his desire to modernize Russia and his desire to preserve Russian traditions.
</h2>
<h2>Chapter 2: The Geopolitics of Putin</h2>
<p>
In the second chapter of Putin VS Putin, Dugin examines the geopolitics of Putin. He argues that Putin is a geopolitical thinker who is committed to the restoration of Russia's great power status.
</p>
<p>
Dugin argues that Putin is following a geopolitical strategy that is based on the principles of Eurasianism. Eurasianism is a geopolitical ideology that argues that Russia should be the leader of a new Eurasian empire.
</p>
<p>
Dugin argues that Putin's geopolitical strategy is a challenge to the Western-led world order. He argues that Putin is trying to create a new world order in which Russia is the dominant power.
</h2>
<h2>Chapter 3: The Future of Putinism</h2>
<p>
In the third chapter of Putin VS Putin, Dugin discusses the future of Putinism. He argues that Putinism is a new ideology that is based on the principles of Eurasianism and traditionalism.
</p>
<p>
Dugin argues that Putinism is a challenge to Western liberalism. He argues that Putinism is a new ideology that is gaining popularity in the world.
</p>
<p>
Dugin argues that the future of Putinism is uncertain. He argues that it is possible that Putinism will become the dominant ideology in the world, or it is possible that it will be defeated by Western liberalism.
