Friedrich Nietzsche - Philosophical Works and Letters (71 books)

FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE (1844-1900) was a German philosopher, cultural critic, poet, philologist and composer.  His thought has had a profound impact on 20th and early-21st century philosophers -- especially in schools of continental philosophy such as existentialism, postmodernism, and post-structuralism -- as well as across the arts, literature, psychology, politics, and popular culture.

Nietzsche's body of work touched widely on art, philology, history, religion, tragedy, culture, and science, and drew early inspiration from figures such as Schopenhauer, Wagner, and Goethe.  His writing spans philosophical polemics, poetry, cultural criticism, and fiction while displaying a fondness for aphorism and irony.  Some prominent elements of his philosophy include his radical critique of truth in favor of perspectivism; his genealogical critique of religion and Christian morality, and his related theory of master-slave morality;] his aesthetic affirmation of existence in response to the "death of God" and the profound crisis of nihilism; his notion of the Apollonian and Dionysian; and his characterization of the human subject as the expression of competing wills, collectively understood as the will to power.  In his later work, he developed influential concepts such as the Übermensch and the doctrine of eternal return, and became increasingly preoccupied with the creative powers of the individual to overcome social, cultural, and moral contexts in pursuit of new values and aesthetic health.

This collection is a fully revised and substantially updated version of my earlier torrent.  It includes every major work by Nietzsche, most in multiple translations and in modern critical editions, as well as several important anthologies and compilations of letters.  Oscar Levy's early edition of Nietzsche's writing (1909-1913), long since superseded by modern scholarship, is reproduced in the Complete Works issued by Delphi Classics.
