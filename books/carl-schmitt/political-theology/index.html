<h2>Chapter 1: Definition of Sovereignty</h2>
<p>In the opening chapter of “Political Theology” by Carl Schmitt, the author begins by examining the concept of sovereignty. Schmitt argues that sovereignty is the key determining factor in political decision-making. He explores how sovereignty establishes the foundation for a functioning political order and maintains the unity and stability of a state.</p>
<p>From a traditional perspective, sovereignty is viewed as a divine attribute bestowed upon rulers to ensure the preservation of order and justice. The traditional understanding of sovereignty recognizes the authority of a legitimate ruler who acts as the representative of divine will.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: The Concept of Political Theology</h2>
<p>This chapter delves into the concept of political theology and its relationship with sovereignty. Schmitt explores how political theology intersects with religion and the role of religious beliefs in shaping political authority and legitimacy.</p>
<p>From a traditional standpoint, “<em>political theology</em>” emphasizes the inseparable connection between religious and political spheres. It recognizes that political power derives its legitimacy from divine sources and that the ruler's authority is intertwined with spiritual and moral principles.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Political Theology and the Concept of the State</h2>
<p>In this chapter, Schmitt examines the relationship between political theology and the concept of the state. He explores how political theology shapes the understanding of the state as a transcendent entity with a divine purpose.</p>
<p>From a traditional perspective, the state is seen as a manifestation of divine order and the embodiment of moral and spiritual principles. The traditional concept of the state emphasizes its duty to promote the common good, uphold justice, and protect the natural rights of individuals.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: The Problem of Sovereignty and Democracy</h2>
<p>This chapter addresses the tension between sovereignty and democracy. Schmitt argues that democracy, with its emphasis on popular sovereignty and majority rule, poses a challenge to the traditional understanding of sovereignty.</p>
<p>From a traditional point of view, the tension between sovereignty and democracy arises from the belief that ultimate authority lies with a higher power rather than the collective will of the people. Traditional thought recognizes the need for wise and virtuous rulers who govern in accordance with divine principles, ensuring the stability and order of society.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5: Political Theology and the State of Exception</h2>
<p>In the final chapter, Schmitt explores the concept of the state of exception, where the normal legal order is suspended in times of crisis. He argues that political theology plays a crucial role in legitimizing and justifying the state's extraordinary measures during exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>From a traditional perspective, the state of exception is viewed as a necessary response to preserve the greater good and protect society from imminent threats. Traditional thought recognizes the need for temporary deviations from ordinary legal procedures to restore order and safeguard the well-being of the community.</p>
