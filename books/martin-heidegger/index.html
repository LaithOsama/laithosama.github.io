    <h1>Martin Heidegger</h1>
    <p>Born in Germany in 1889, Martin Heidegger was one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. His work is characterized by a deep exploration of the nature of Being and the human experience.</p>
    
    <h2>Heidegger's Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Heidegger's philosophy is centered around the concept of "Dasein," or "being-there," which refers to the experience of being that is peculiar to human beings. Heidegger believed that modern technology and the emphasis on rationality in Western philosophy have led to a forgetfulness of Being, resulting in a state of existential alienation.</p>
