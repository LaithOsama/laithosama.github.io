Martin Heidegger - Philosophical Works and Letters (81 books)

MARTIN HEIDEGGER (1889-1976) was a German philosopher who is widely acknowledged to be one of the most original and important thinkers of the 20th century.  He is best known for his contributions to philosophical hermeneutics and his existential and phenomenological explorations of the "question of Being" (Dasein).  Heidegger's influence has been far-reaching, extending into fields such as theology, art, architecture, artificial intelligence, cultural anthropology, design, literary theory, social theory, political theory, psychiatry, and psychotherapy.

His first and best known book, BEING AND TIME (1927), though unfinished, was immediately recognized as an original and groundbreaking philosophical work, and later became a focus of debates and controversy, and a profound influence on 20th-century philosophy.  It is here presented in two translations.  Heidegger also made critical contributions to philosophical conceptions of truth, arguing that its original meaning was unconcealment, to philosophical analyses of art as a site of the revelation of truth, and to philosophical understanding of language as the "house of being."  His later work includes criticisms of technology's instrumentalist understanding in the Western tradition as "enframing", treating all of Nature as a "standing reserve" on call for human purposes.

He remains a controversial figure, largely for his affiliation with Nazism, as Rector of the University of Freiburg for 11 months, before his resignation in April 1934, for which he neither apologized nor publicly expressed regret.  THE BLACK NOTEBOOKS (2014) contain more explicitly anti-Semitic content than Heidegger's previously published writings, reigniting the debate about Heidegger's Nazism and its relationship to his philosophical project.
