<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
<hr>
<p>An independent, non-profit digital library run by one person, I hold it in my hands for the benefit of my nation, hoping that it will benefit the community and make it an ongoing charity for anyone who participates in it.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have noticed the problems with Arabic digital libraries, which usually include books of little value (mostly novels and human development classifications) filled with advertisements of all kinds and javascript. Along with poor programming, they are difficult to use and may take minutes to download a single book. With all of this and more in mind, I have decided to create a digital library that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provides Arabic translation whenever available, accompanied by English to avoid poor translations.</li>
<li>Provides books that work to increase cognitive awareness, broaden your horizons, and move away from unhelpful novels and human development books.</li>
<li>Focuses more on books that support tradition and discourage progress, with attention paid to religious books as well.</li>
<li>Attempts to find the best software solutions to make the site as fast and clean as possible.</li>
<li>Does not include any ads at all, with minimal use of javascript (only a few lines for the search feature, which I can avoid in the future and replace with database rules).</li>
<li>Easy to use. Just click on the book to download it.</li>
</ol>
<h1>TODO List:</h1>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Expand the site's capabilities and add database rules to increase search options.</li>
<li>Provide a full page for each book containing a review of the book and perhaps criticism (requires time and assistance from some friends, so it should not be expected to be achieved soon).</li>
<li>Continuously strive to minimize programming texts and use functions that are suitable for older browsers.</li>
</ol>
